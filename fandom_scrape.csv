Iryt had his race's short stature and dense structure caused by the high gravity of his home [[Planet/Legends|planet]], [[Kaump III]]. He also had the characteristic short limbs and flat face of his people. He preferred clothes which accented his strength and attitude, preferring to wear leather garments with studs and spikes.

The Mandalorian captain looked much like standard officers, wearing grey clothing underneath light body armor. He had a yellow insignia on his left shoulder and his helmet bore two small crests on top. His visor, unlike most officers', did not consist of two sections for the eyes. Rather, it was one large slit that covered both.

Jaden's usual outfit consists of the standard [[Slifer Red]] uniform, unbuttoned, and a black shirt underneath. A [[Main Deck|Deck]] box is strapped above his waistline, largely hidden beneath the lower rim of his jacket. In the first episode he is seen wearing a high school uniform similar to the one worn by [[Yugi Muto]], though colored black instead of blue. He also wore a KaibaCorp Duel Disk on his left arm for his entrance exam Duel. His brown eyes are positioned directly beneath the bangs of the layer closest to his face. After joining Duel Academy, he carries an [[Academia Disk|Academy-issued Duel Disk]] on his left arm.

In the fourth season, Jaden is seen with his new look, but he is still easy to identify from the past seasons. He comes back a bit taller, with longer hair, a longer, darker Slifer Red jacket, darker jeans and, since he fused his soul with Yubel in the third season, occasionally manifesting its power to protect himself in the form of his eyes glowing the same bichromatic scheme Yubel's did. His eyes have also been redesigned. His Duel Disk is now fully customized with red outlines on it representing his dorm, though otherwise it looks the same (although the difference is very noticeable).

Yugi's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. His normal outfit consists of the standard male Domino Junior/Senior High uniform complete with a closed buckled collar. His extremely extravagant hair features multiple layers including long blond crooked, pointy locks for his fringe; the rest features a set of five large spikes and two smaller spikes colored black with a magenta sheen along the edges. So far, he is the only character in the franchise to have his hair divided into three colors. He wears the [[Millennium Puzzle]] on a lace around his neck. The lace is later replaced with a chain. He often wears a [[Duel Disk 2|KaibaCorp Duel Disk]] on his left arm.

When he played ''Dungeon Dice Monsters'' against [[Duke Devlin]], he wore a black long-sleeved shirt, a gray sleeveless vest, dark blue pants, and black shoes.

When he and [[Téa Gardner|Téa]] took a day together to find out about the [[Millennium Puzzle]], he wore a black linen shirt and several pieces of wrist-chains, along with a pair of leather pants.

In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters]]'', Yugi wore a different attire of a violet jacket and jeans. He also wore the [[Capsule Shooter]] on his left arm. In Episode 4, he gained a Duel armor that allowed him to become one with one of his capsule monsters.

In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', Yugi went through noticeable development. While physically resembling Atem, he is much taller and has a lean-built frame. During this time, Yugi's present-day eyes are not directly shown.

https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki,Yami Yugi,"
[[File:Img_show.aspx.jpeg|thumb|left|Yami Yugi lineart]] Yugi's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]].

As he exists in Yugi's body, his appearance is largely the same as Yugi's, although many alterations are made when Yami takes control, such as his eyes. However, Yami Yugi has a more mature appearance, being taller in stature and having a deeper voice in the dub. In the Japanese version, though, very little change can be detected in Yugi and Yami Yugi's voice. His eyes are also narrower with a more intense, determined gaze. He also appears more muscular.

Yami Yugi's hair features multiple layers including long blond crocked, pointy locks for his fringe. Unlike Yugi, some of the blond locks jut upwards. The rest of his hair features five large spikes colored black with red (with a hint of magenta) rims all along the edges. The spikes were loose and free flowing at the beginning of the manga, but over time became stiffer.

In many illustrations Yami Yugi is depicted having purple eyes like Yugi. But in some of the cover pictures of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga, he is depicted having aqua green colored eyes.

At the beginning of the series, his outfit consists of the standard male Domino High uniform complete with a closed buckled collar and a large set of Ankh cufflinks on his sleeves, which weren't present when Yugi was in control. Underneath the male Domino High uniform he wears a dark blue or purple leather jacket with gold-studded buttons, replaced by a simple dark grey singlet during [[Battle City|Battle City Tournament]] story arc. It is also noted that his uniform becomes a darker shade of blue when Yami Yugi assumes control. Also, during Duelist Kingdom, Yugi's blue and white sneakers would turn into solid blue boot-like shoes when Yami takes control. The Ankhs were later removed. Unlike Yugi, Yami Yugi sometimes wears the jacket as a cape, which could be because of actually wearing one when he was Pharaoh.

He wears the Millennium Puzzle on a brown leather rope around his neck. The leather rope is later replaced with a chain.

When he and [[Téa Gardner|Téa]] took a day together to find out about the Millennium Puzzle, he wore black linen and several pieces of wrist-chains, to match the Millennium Puzzle's chain.

In [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters]], Yami wears a different attire of a violet jacket and jeans. He also wears the [[Capsule Shooter]] on his left arm. In episode 4, he gains Duel armor that allows him to become one with one of his capsule monsters.

Kaiba's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. His usual outfit from the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|second series anime]] (starting in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 054|episode 54]]) consists of a long white sleeveless [[KaibaCorp]]-designed coat featuring shoulder pads and a raised studded collar, with black sleeves from his shirt coming out from under. He has extra belts in pairs strapped around his upper arms and shins. He often wears a [[KC mass production Disk|KaibaCorp Duel Disk]] on his left arm.

In his initial appearance and his first loss to [[Yami Yugi]], he wears a blue standard Domino High School uniform.

During the events of the Duelist Kingdom arc (starting in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 008|episode 8]]), he wears a long indigo blue trenchcoat with a dark teal long sleeved button shirt with an extended collar, a matching pants with a white belt on his waist and black shoes. He later wears this outfit during the events of the Legendary Heroes arc (lastly in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 045|episode 45]]). A flashback in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 102|episode 102]] (set before the beginning of the series) shows him wearing his indigo outfit when he rejects [[Crump]]'s proposition for a penguin theme park and forced [[Nezbitt]] to destroy his lab.

In [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 052|episode 52]], in which he meets [[Ishizu Ishtar]] and gains ""[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]"", his long trenchcoat becomes purple and his teal button shirt and pants are replaced with a black turtleneck and matching pants and dons a steel wristbands in both of his wrist. He wears his purple outfit again for his first few appearances in the Doma arc (including when he gains ""[[Fang of Critias|The Fang of Critias]]""), from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 145|episode 145]] to [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 159|episode 159]], before returning to his standard outfit in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 165|episode 165]]. 

In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime)|first series anime]], Kaiba has green hair, while in the manga, Toei's ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' movie, and the second series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters'', Kaiba has brown hair with bangs down to the top of his eyes and a hairline at the base of the neck. Kaiba's character design in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

Bakura's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]].

In the [[Duelist Kingdom]] arc, he wears a white wool sweater and green undershirt. His usual outfit in following seasons consists of a blue opened shirt over a light blue and white horizontally striped t-shirt. Bakura has brown eyes and white hair. His hair is pointed downwards in various directions and trails half way down his back. He wears the [[Millennium Ring]] on a lace around his neck. In the manga, during the Ceremonial Battle, he wore a different white t-shirt. Bakura is fair-skinned.

Téa's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]].

In the manga, Anzu originally had a conventional, short hairstyle. Her first color image, seen in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel 001|Duel 1]], featured dark brown hair and amber eyes. As Takahashi continued drawing the manga, Anzu gained more feminine and cute facial features. Her hair style became longer and less conventional. Color images from Volume 3 and onward portray her hair as a lighter brown color. Sometimes her eyes are blue and sometimes they are reddish brown. By the final volume of the manga, Anzu's hair touches her shoulders. Anzu's usual outfit is the standard female Domino High School uniform, consising of a pink coat, a white oxford shirt, a blue tie, and a blue pleated skirt, though she does not stick to any usual casual outfit and wears several throughout the series.

In the first series anime, her hair and eyes are of a reddish brown color. Her school uniform color differs; her coat is orange and her tie and skirt are green. In the amusement park episode, she wore a light-green bikini.

In the second series anime, she has brown hair and blue eyes. On occasions she wore the school uniform colored in the same manner as in the manga. Her brown shoulder-length hair is sectioned into two layers, consisting of a darker shade of brown inner layer, with the outer layer of a lighter shade.

During the first season of the anime, her usual outfit is comprised of a yellow shirt, which flows like a skirt at her thighs, with a pink waistcoat over it, and a blue miniskirt. A pair of brown knee-high boots completed her ensemble.[[File:Téa Gardner.jpg|100px|thumb|Téa Gardner during the Battle City and Virtual World arcs.|right]]In the second and third season, her clothes consists of a light green sleeveless buttoned shirt with yellow collar, pink and blue bracelets, navy shorts with a light blue belt, white thigh-high socks, and blue strapped platform sandals. Prior to being held captive by the Rare Hunters, she also possessed a light yellow handbag. She also wears a yellow tank-top with the word ""SPIRIT"" on it (which was removed from the dub) and a red skirt on occasion in the second season.

She also wears another outfit: a yellow tube-top, red choker, light pink shorts, black thigh-high socks, red platform sandals, and a pink jacket. In the fourth and fifth season she wears a black sleeveless shirt that reveals her belly button, a red skirt and a pair of white high-heeled boots. During the trip to [[Industrial Illusions]], she wears a white jacket over a red tank top, a pleated yellow skirt, and tan boots and she also wears the same outfit at the KC Grand Championship.

In the 4th season, she wears a yellow jacket, blue shirt, short shorts, cyan socks and blue and white sneakers. In the 4th episode of said season, she wears a black tank top which slightly covers her belly button, navy short shorts with a gray belt, and yellow wristbands.

In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters]]'', her clothes consists of a dark pink jacket, light green shirt, with a beige and neck tie, an emerald-green skirt and brown boots.

Serenity wears light blue denim shorts and long white socks with blue sneakers. Her top is a sleeveless pink and white shirt with a high collar that is worn on top of a short-sleeved yellow shirt. She does not change this outfit throughout the series except when she is in the hospital, where she wears simple pink pajamas. The photo [[Joey Wheeler]] has of her in his wallet shows her dressed in a sailor fuku common to middle school students in Japan. In the Japanese version of the final episode's end credits, she wears a white shirt with some pink linings around the edge of its collar, sleeves and bottom, and a orange short skirt. In the manga, she wears longer sleeves and jeans rather than the shorter clothes that she wears in the anime. She has auburn hair with long bangs framing the sides of her face and a cowlick of four small hairs that cover the middle part of her forehead. She has greenish brown eyes.

[[File:Npc-marik.png|right|200px]]

Upon first awakening in the anime, he was wearing the original outfit of Marik, including a light purple sleeveless hoodie, black pants and black shoes, but wore most of his normal clothes underneath the hoodie in the manga. Yami Marik's usual outfit consists of a long purple cape with a gold chain, and the black sleeveless tank top and beige pants from the manga, making the whereabouts of his new clothes a trivial mystery. He wears golden earrings, neckwear, armbands and bracelets. His hair is spiked upwards and points in all directions, though he retains the same wing-like fringes of Marik's hair, and since he picked up the [[Millennium Rod]], which he keeps in his belt while not carrying it, he bears the [[Eye of Anubis]] on his forehead. After he defeats [[Yami Bakura]], he takes the [[Millennium Ring]], wearing it around his neck for the remainder of the tournament, but concealing it beneath his tank top until he reveals it to Yami Yugi during their Duel.

While Dueling, faint, ghastly images of his face frequently stretch out from his head. As the series progressed, visible veins slowly start to appear on his face. In the [[Battle City]] arc, he wears a [[Duel Disk|KaibaCorp Duel Disk]] on his left arm. As he is merely a split personality of the normal Marik, unlike Yami Yugi and Yami Bakura, who are both entirely different entities from their associated hosts in their own right, Yami Marik's facial structure is exactly the same as Marik's, though the similarities are offset by the differences outlined above.

In the present, he wore a white and orange-striped open-collared shirt with a red sweatshirt over it, a light blue bandana around his neck, light blueish-green jeans, and light blue/black sneakers. Occasionally, Mokuba puts up his bandana like a mask and wears a purple hat to hide his identity. During the events of Battle City, Mokuba wears a green blue-striped shirt with a yellow vest over it, dark blue jeans, and blue sneakers.

In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions]]'', Mokuba was given a redesign, wearing a white business suit and having his long hair chopped off.

Syrus's character design was overseen by [[Kenichi Hara]]. His usual outfit consists of the standard [[Duel Academy]] uniform with alternating colors over the course of the series. The designs for all three uniforms worn by Syrus are identical in basic makeup. With his red uniform, a yellow shirt is worn underneath the jacket, whereas with his yellow uniform, this is reversed. With his blue uniform, the shirt is black, and the collar has buttons not present in his other incarnations - similar to Chazz's uniform before he attended [[North Academy]]. The blue uniform also has fins in the back similar to his brother's outfit also not on his other uniforms.

His blue hair (of a lighter tint than his brother's) is sectioned in three layers, his grey eyes positioned between the three bangs closest to his face and behind a pair of round-lensed glasses. He carries an Academy-issued [[Duel Disk]] on his left hand. He has also been shown wearing the Academy jersey when necessary. In episode 8, during a flashback sequence when he was young, he wore a yellow collared shirt with blue shorts and black sneakers.  At the end of Episode 64, while searching for Jaden he wears an explorer outfit, consisting of a khaki hat, a khaki collared shirt with a blue undershirt, khaki shorts, white socks, and his (at the time) [[Ra Yellow]] uniform shoes.

In the first season of the dub, Syrus often makes a joke about how [[Zane Truesdale|his brother]] has amazing Dueling skills while apparently he always had ""the looks"".

When Blair returned near the end of season 2, she was once again disguised, since she still used her bandanna and wore a kabuki mask. She now wore a sleeveless orange shirt under an dark blue and aqua version of the [[Obelisk Blue]] jacket with blue jeans and lilac boots. Starting from season 3, Blair's main outfit consists of her orange shirt, a Slifer vest, black shorts with a slanted brown belt, black socks that went slightly above her knees and newly designed Slifer boots.

Sartorius' character design was overseen by Kenichi Hara. His usual outfit consists of the standard Obelisk Blue uniform with a raised and buckled collar and matching cut-offs for his arms and legs. A Deck box is strapped to his right leg, presumably to house his regular tarot Deck. His blue hair is sectioned in two layers, the layer closest to his face a lighter shade of blue than the one behind it, which generally flows as a single unit. Directly above his nose is another section of hair, colored grayish white, and he also wears earrings and a pair of ornaments on either side of his forehead. He carries an [[Academia Disk]] on his left hand despite his initial preference of Dueling on a table, even claiming to have never used a Duel Disk before prior to Dueling [[Tyranno Hassleberry|Hassleberry]].

Interestingly, Sartorius donned his Obelisk blue uniform well before enrolling in Duel Academy.

His natural complexion is flesh-tone; however, with his evil personality in dominance, his skin takes on a more pallid quality. Furthermore, his eyes are more sinister and glazed over by light. When completely corrupted by [[The Light of Destruction]], his hair becomes wild, his face inhumanely twisted, and his teeth elongated.

Mai's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. Mai is fair-skinned with purple eyes, large silver hoop earrings, and long, thick, spiky blonde hair. In the anime, at [[Duelist Kingdom]], Mai wore a short-sleeved purple coat over her white tube top, exposing her midriff, black socks along with recurring purple high-heeled boots. From [[Battle City]] on, she changed to a sleeveless light purple vest and a white tank top and wore long white fingerless gloves. She wears a dark purple miniskirt and a Deck holder strapped to her thigh in the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City arcs and her cameo appearances at KC Grand Championship arc, but in [[Waking the Dragons]], she wears dark purple shorts and vest, black corset, dark purple thigh-high high heeled boots, a black choker with an [[Orichalcos Stone]], and a [[Chaos Duel Disk]] on her left arm, in addition to black fingerless gloves. In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'', she is seen in an outfit similar to the one she wore in Waking the Dragons. However, her top is white/grey instead of black.

In the manga, in [[Duelist Kingdom]], she largely wore the same outfit as the anime, but her top was open, revealing the middle of her chest and held together using strings, like a corset. In Battle City, she changed to wearing a black leather vest and miniskirt, and wore a similar tube top as her Duelist Kingdom self, but with the front closed.

In the dub, from Season 2 onwards, her cleavage and lines of cleavage are digitally reduced or erased, and her skirt is lengthened.

During the course of the series, Kalin wears a variety of outfits correlating to notable moments in his life. During the Enforcers era, Kalin wears a brown leather vest, customary of all Enforcer members, lined with beige fur. Under the vest he wears a red, short sleeve, shirt, notably with a ""V"" shaped cutout just below his collarbone. Below this, he wears a black leather belt, dark blue jeans, and black boots. He also wears black gloves with a metal band adorn with spikes. A signature to this attire is Kalin's purple headband.

In prison, Kalin is stripped of his Enforcer attire and wears a dark blue, simple, shirt and pants combination. He also now has a criminal mark.

https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki,Jakob,"
[[File:Jose.png|thumb|180px|left|Linework]]
Jakob is the largest member both in height and mass of the [[Three Pure Nobles]]. Although no official height has been given, Jakob is over seven feet tall, and has massive arms, as seen when [[Sherry LeBlanc|Sherry]] was able to wrap her entire body around one of his arms. As the oldest Noble of [[Iliaster]], Jakob has wrinkled skin, most notably under his eyes, and a long, father-time style gray beard that reaches all the way down to his waist. In addition to the beard, Jakob has an overgrown right eyebrow that covers his right eye, and his left eye is yellow. Other than the beard and the eyebrow, Jakob does not have any other hair on his head. Being one of [[Aporia]]'s embodiments, he strongly resembles Aporia while in his old age, but the original Aporia was short and slim, while Jakob was tall and muscular.

Like the other Nobles, Jakob primarily wears white, has a white cloak and hood, and a red gem on his head. Unlike the other Nobles though, Jakob's gem is above his right eye instead of between his eyes. He also has a gray patch with an infinity symbol on his face, but unlike [[Lester]] and [[Primo]], Jakob's patch covers his nose and mouth similar to a gas mask, which muffles his voice.

Jakob's color variation other than the white is a dark golden orange, as seen on his pants, front, and the shoulder pads that pin his cloak. Jakob wears black gloves, metal arm bands and black boots. His pants, which are the golden orange and white, are loose around his feet, and underneath Jakob wears black boots. The white cloak that Jakob wears covers a white armor shell over his chest, back, and shoulders, which on the front bears an infinity symbol similar to that of the ""[[Meklord Emperor]]s"". However, rather than a glowing green core, Jakob's symbol is shut. Directly underneath the symbol on the chest, Jakob's abdomen unfolds to reveal a [[Duel Disk]] is built into him.

Lester is a young boy about the age of [[Leo]] and [[Luna]]. He is skinny, has green eyes, pale, and while short, he is tall for the age group he is portrayed as being. He has waist-length, dark red hair, keeping it pulled back by wrapping end in a black cloth. Qualities that he shares with the other two [[Three Pure Nobles|Nobles]] is that he wears primarily white and has a white hood. In addition, he has a gray patch (which covers his left eye), and a blue gem in the middle of his forehead. 

[[File:D Board Lester.png|thumb|180px|Linework when dueling.]]
Unique to Lester though is in addition to white, he wears blue and green colors, most notably blue in-line skates as oppose to shoes or boots. His most unique attribute to his appearance though is a bar that floats around him at his shoulder height, which he uses as a Duel Disk and can connect to the metal collar he wears through the infinity symbol on the front when he activates it or to a disk he can attach to his right arm. Most of the time, Lester wears a white cloak over his Duel Disk when he is not using it.

[[File:DA Lester.png|thumb|left|180px|Linework as a Duel Academy Student.]]
The only time Lester's appearance has significantly changed was when he went undercover at Duel Academy. Other than donning a Duel Academy uniform instead of his Iliaster wardrobe, he also took his patch off his left eye, hid the blue gem on his forehead, and instead pulled his hair back in one long braid.

He has a gray metallic eyepiece that covers his right eye, and a triangular green circuitry-filled gem on his forehead, set off-center towards the left. He wears white hood, with decorative gray lightning bolts that point backwards like horns. Under his hood, he is pale-skinned, red-eyed and has spiky gray hair split down the middle into two different shades. He has a bald spot above his right eye with and small mark in the middle. Underneath his left eye, Primo has a scar that runs down his cheek.

[[File:Placido.png|thumb|right|Primo with his hood up.]]
Primo is dressed in gray metallic armor, the major portion of which forms a large hoop-like collar around his neck that connects to encircle a large green gem on his chest, giving its Infinity-themed look. A piece of armor runs down his back and opens up to reveal a series of ports, which attach to tubes on his [[Duel Runner]]. The armor pieces around his waist holds up a white train-like cloak that covers his legs. Underneath his armor, Primo wears a white turtle-neck body suit with a black stripe that runs down the center. Primo also wears white thigh-high boots with hidden data ports that can attach to his Duel Runner, as well as arm length black and white sleeve covers that are adorned with red gems at the wrist and upper arm. These seem to be part of his body as it is revealed that his Deck, and Deck holder rests in a space inside his arm that can be accessed by opening the jewel at his wrist. 

[[File:PlacidoLine2.png|thumb|left|180px|Linework of his newly rebuilt self.]]
Primo was ripped in half upon being defeated by [[Yusei Fudo|Yusei]], however he later returns having been fully rebuilt with shown with new red markings on his face; one beneath his left eye, another that runs down the left side of his face, and one coming from the side of his face. His hair also is spikier than it previously was. This form is referred to as ''Placido Ripresa''.

Primo carries his sword on his right side (because he's left-handed). Gold with an infinity symbol between the hilt and the blade, the sword serves to create portals, as a Duel Disk, and as the key that allows Primo to combine with his Duel Runner: the T-666 [[Terrible Omen]]. It is stored in a long black scabbard that seems to float at Primo's waist.

[[File:PlacidoLine3.png|thumb|right|180px|Linework as a butler.]]

As for her clothing, when she was a child, she wore a pink and purple striped jumper over a lilac vest top along with a dark red skirt and purple sneakers. Notably her jumper was too big for her, so one of her shoulders poked out of the neck hole. In the [[World Duel Carnival]], she wore a pink blouse with a purple undershirt, a white business suit, and purple tights with black spike high heels and an anklet around her right ankle matching the one on Nistro's left wrist.

Yuri's face resembles that of his counterparts. He has very short, thick, pink eyebrows and purple eyes. Like his counterparts, his hair is two-toned, in his case being uniformly violet with pink underneath - his fringes extending to frame his face, with two pointing upwards.

His outfit appears to be an officer's uniform of sorts, consisting of a purple and light blue waistcoat, pink cravat, a two-part cape of red and purple that resembles [[Yuya Sakaki]]'s coat, a purple abbreviated coat with thick cuffs and gold shoulder bands with an amber-colored setting, fastened at the collar bone, and light blue pants tucked into silver-tinted leather boots. When he kidnapped Lulu and [[Rin]], Yuri wore a brown hooded cloak that obscured his identity.

Yuri and his dimensional counterparts' attire and hair are all based on the color of the cards that their dimensions are based on. As such, Yuri wears purple like the color of [[Fusion Monster]]s, and the top layer of his hair is purple. Yuri's design also seems to take cues from those of his dimensional counterparts; wearing a cape resembling Yuya's coat, a long coat that evokes [[Yuto]]'s torn one, and a short jacket similar in form to [[Yugo]]'s.

As a child, Yuri wore purple-colored long-sleeved shirt with a pocket on the left side of the chest, orange-colored buttons and black-colored collar, white pants and brown shoes.

The Battle Beast's design seems to be based two-fold, around a Roman gladiator (like his Deck) and also of an archetypal barbarian. While young, the Battle Beast is tall and rather muscular with a lean, well-built frame with a wide chest and large shoulders. His hair is reddish brown and very long, as it passes his shoulders and reaches his back, while also sporting two bangs, both of which almost reach his abdomen. Due to him wearing very little clothing, most of his frame is revealed. The only real clothes he wears are a pair of ragged trousers/shorts, which further emphasizes the brutish theme of his design. He wears a very simplistic necklace with three green fangs and two red orbs, with the center fang being visibly the longest of them. He also wears black wristbands, and has a white armband on his right arm's biceps. On the left side of his upper body, he has a black armband/gladiatorial-like shoulder pauldron, with orange studs around the circumference. Cementing his barbarian motif even further, he walks barefoot.

The Warrior wears bright red armor with shoulder pads, bracers, and boots. Its hair is red in the original NES version - due to palette limitations, the Warrior's hair is the same color as its armor - and is short and messy. The Knight has a more muscular build than the Warrior and its hair is slicked back.

The Playstation ''Origins'' port updates the designs for the Warrior and Knight, and these sprites are also used for the Game Boy Advance ''Dawn of Souls'' port. The Warrior has silver trim on its shoulder pads and boots, wears a yellow belt, and its hair is brown or dirty blond. The Knight has primarily silver armor with red accents, its hair is swept back, and it wears a silver headpiece. The Knight also wears a yellow cape, which the Playstation Portable ''20th Anniversary'' port recolors red. In its artwork for the ''Dawn of Souls'' port, the Warrior has red armor with gold and yellow details, a brown belt, and brown boots.

FMVs in the ''Origins'' port give the Warrior/Knight an appearance closer to Yoshitaka Amano's concept art for the Warrior of Light. The Warrior/Knight wears pale blue plate armor with a yellow cape, a helmet with a long pair of horns pointing forward, and has pale blond hair.

[[File:Blackmage-ff1-art.png|thumb|right|225px|Artwork from ''[[Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls|Dawn of Souls]]''.]]
The Black Mage has had a consistent appearance across all ports of ''Final Fantasy''. They wear long blue robes with loose sleeves and a pointed yellow hat. Their face is obscured with only two yellow eyes visible within the shadows of their hat. In the NES version of ''Final Fantasy'', it was unclear of the Black Mage was wearing gloves or had bare hands emerging from its robes; the Playstation ''Origins'' port makes it clear it is the Black Mage's hands. The ''Origins'' port also adds a light brown stripe around the Black Mage's hat.

The Black Wizard's appearance in the NES version has them remove their hat, revealing their face and short brown hair, and they have brought shoulder pads added to their robe. The MSX2 port gives the Black Wizard darker blue robes and purple hair and shoulder pads. From the ''Origins'' release on, the Black Wizard was redesigned and draws on elements of the [[Magus (job)|Magus]], an ""upgraded"" Black Mage job that [[Magus (Final Fantasy III)|first apppeared]] in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]''. The Black Wizard wears a blue coat with gold trim and held closed by a belt, and green and yellow striped pants. It retains its yellow hat which still conceals its face in shadow, but the stripe on the hat is now green. The Playstation Portable ''20th Anniversary'' port used a variant of this design that gives the Black Wizard a blue cloak worn around its shoulders, pants striped with two shades of brown, and the stripe in its hat is brown again.

[[File:Whitemage-ff1-art.png|thumb|right|225px|Artwork from ''[[Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls|Dawn of Souls]]''.]]
The White Mage's appearance is consistent across all releases of ''Final Fantasy'', with minor adjustments due to improved graphics. The White Mage wears a white robe with long sleeves, a hood, and red triangle trim along the edges. In the original NES release they have red hair, but the Playstation ''Origins'' port gives them light brown or blond hair, which is retained in the Game Boy Advance ''Dawn of Souls'' and Playstation Portable ''20th Anniversary'' ports. As the White Wizard they lower their hood to reveal their head, have a red collar around their neck, and their sleeves are shorter and tighter around the arm, allowing their hands to be seen.

The gender identity of the White Mage is ambiguous. Starting with the ''Origins'' port, in contrast to the generally masculine designs of the other five jobs, the White Mage has a feminine appearance. Additionally, the ''Dawn of Souls'' and ''20th Anniversary'' ports give the players a list of pre-chosen names to use for jobs which are taken from other ''Final Fantasy'' characters; most of the names offered for the White Mage are for females, while the other five jobs have mostly male names. The official novelization ''[[Final Fantasy: Memory of Heroes]]'' identifies the White Mage as a female. However, no version of ''Final Fantasy'' assigns a name or gender identity to any of the Warriors of Light, and it is left to the player's discretion to do so or not as they see fit.

In the original NES version of ''Final Fantasy'', and in the ''Pixel Remaster'' version, the Thief wears brown armor with blue hair. The MSX2 port of the game changed the Thief to wear purple-pink armor instead. As a Ninja it wears a red body suit with a black sash and a hood and cowl.

The Playstation ''Origins'' port updates the designs for the Thief and Ninja, and these sprites are also used for the Game Boy Advance ''Dawn of Souls'' port. The Thief wears a bright green vest over a pink tunic, and a brown belt and pink boots. It has blond hair tied with a bandana. As a Ninja they wear bright green ninja garb with yellow trim, a hood and cowl, and a yellow sash. The Playstation Portable ''20th Anniversary'' port keeps to the basics of this design, but recolors the Thief's tunic and boots brown and the Ninja's armor red.

The Red Mage's appearance has been consistent across all releases of ''Final Fantasy'', with minor adjustments due to improved graphics. The Red Mage wears red armor with a red cape, a red hat with a wide brim and a feather, and they have long white hair. As a Red Wizard, in the original NES version they are identical to the Red Mage in overall design, with a redesigned sprite to appear taller, and a slightly different cape that has a visible clasp. The Playstation ''Origins'' port, and the Game Boy Advance ''Dawn of Souls'' port that was based on it, give the Red Mage gold trim on their cape and boots, and as the Red Wizard they gain a white ruffle on their collar and additional silver/white details on their armor.

The Master looks identical to the Monk but with a more muscular figure and a taller-looking sprite. The MSX2 port gives the two dark blue robes, purple bracers, and green hair. 

The Playstation ''Origins'' port updates the designs for the Monk and the Master, and these sprites are also used for the Game Boy Advance ''Dawn of Souls'' port. The Monk wears dark purple robes with a belt, headband, and bracers, which are colored red, and they have brown or dark blond hair. The Master wears a sleeveless blue coat with gold trim, a red belt and bracers, and its hair is tied in a ponytail.

https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki,Garland (Final Fantasy),"
Garland's design varies across different releases of ''Final Fantasy''. His basic design is that of a warrior wearing plate mail with a cape, which varies in color but is usually a shade of blue or purple, and a horned helmet, with two large horns curving out from the sides and two smaller vertical horns on the top. All versions past the NES version give his cape a gold trim, and he has glowing eyes visible within the shadows of his helmet's visor, which are variably yellow or red. Manual artwork for the Game Boy Advance port shows Garland wielding a curved sword, but no version of ''Final Fantasy'' has ever depicted Garland wielding a weapon in-game. Other media, such as FMVs for the PlayStation ''Origins'' port, broadly keep to this design of Garland as an armored knight with a horned helmet and prominently blue armor and cape. 

The in-game manual for ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'' implies that Garland's ""Cloudsea Djinn"" outfit{{Show image|Garland render.png}} is what he looks like under his armor. Otherwise his appearance under his armor has never been seen, save for a piece of ''Nintendo Power'' artwork where Garland's helmet is open, but he is facing away from the reader and has no distinct facial features.
[[File:Dissidia Garland.png|right|thumb|200px|Garland's appearance in ''Dissidia''.]]
Garland's appearance in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. Garland wears a suit of silver and gray armor with gold ornamentation, including gold settings containing blue orbs or gemstones on his waist, elbows, and the back of his hands. His cape is a shade between blue and purple, with gold trim and a gold clasp, and he wields a massive sword identified in other titles as a [[Claymore (weapon)|claymore]]. Since ''Dissidia'', this design has become the basis for Garland's appearance in most other titles. ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]'' updated his design with additional chest and shoulder plates, additional gold detailing on his armor, a new helmet, and a new sword, [[Rebellion (weapon)|Rebellion]], based on his original claymore with decorative gold plating along its length.

Like many character models in ''Final Fantasy X-2'', Shinra is recycled from an unrelated [[Non-player character|non-playable character]] from ''[[Final Fantasy X]].'' He wears a mask with an ochre visor, and a brown full-body suit with lime green mittens. His suit has a blue collar.

His visage under the body suit is unknown, and the [[Fiend Tale]] endings in ''International+Last Mission'' and later versions add a recurring joke on Shinra's mysterious nature as a person who never removes his bodysuit. In [[YAC-13]]'s ending, he short-circuits when trying to analyze Shinra's gender. In [[Skink]]'s ending, after failing to get a kiss from all the maidens he's approached, Shinra kisses him, but it's ambiguous if this cures his curse. In [[YAC-62]]'s ending, he's about to reveal Shinra's secret, but Shinra shuts him down.

Zack is tall, well-built, and has the iconic sky-blue ""[[mako]] eyes"" common to SOLDIER members. Zack's appearance changes during ''Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-''. He starts with spiky black hair with several bangs framing his face and wears a dark blue SOLDIER uniform (even if most 2nd Class members wear red and magenta), gloves, boots, and is equipped with a standard SOLDIER sword.

After being promoted he wears a black 1st Class SOLDIER uniform, and gains the Buster Sword as well as an X-shaped scar on his cheek. His spiky hair grows out and becomes wilder with a single lock of hair hanging down in front of his face. He now has a silver stud earring in his left ear.

While in [[Costa del Sol (Final Fantasy VII)|Costa del Sol]], Zack wears black shorts with a white cord and a yellow design and wields a [[joke equipment|parasol for a makeshift weapon]].

https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki,Sephiroth,"
[[File:Sephiroth-FFVIIArt.png|thumb|left|Original artwork by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]
Sephiroth is a tall man with a muscular build. His long silver hair has bangs parted to either side of his face. In ''[[Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-]]'', the bangs are shorter. Sephiroth has green cat-like eyes {{Show image|Sephiroth E3 2019 VII Remake.png}}. He wears a long black coat with silver pauldrons, black boots and black trousers. The top of his coat is open to reveal his chest, with his leather SOLDIER suspenders crossed over it. In ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'', he has a different belt buckle with a wing motif in the center and small black feathers hanging from it; yellow and green lights reflect from the slots, which may be [[Materia (Final Fantasy VII)|materia]] {{Show image|Sephiroths belt from FFVII Remake.png}}.

He wields the [[Masamune (Final Fantasy VII)|Masamune]] (usually two-handed), a seven-foot-long ōdachi he is rarely seen without. His battle stance with the sword is to hold it over his left shoulder with the blade curving downward, known in the Japanese sword stance as [http://www.akban.org/wiki/Te_Ura_Gasumi_No_Kamae,_Japanese_Sword_stance ''Te Ura Gasumi No Kamae''], which is primarily used in Ninjitsu and [http://www.akban.org/wiki/Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB_(%E5%A4%A9%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E4%BC%9D%E9%A6%99%E5%8F%96%E7%A5%9E%E9%81%93%E6%B5%81 ''Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū''], the latter of which is one of the oldest extant martial arts.

In the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', Sephiroth's uniform remains the same as in ''Final Fantasy VII'', but his coat has several buckles instead of just one. The original SOLDIER logo in his belt is replaced with the redesigned version for the ''Compilation''. According to a ''Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-'' fan letter [[Mail (Crisis Core)|mailed]] to Zack, Sephiroth uses an entire bottle of both shampoo and conditioner to wash his hair. Both are provided by the Shinra Company and are scented with thirteen kinds of perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-'' script:&lt;br/&gt;Dear members of the Silver Elite: In this update, we present another piece of Sephiroth trivia—the secrets to his beautiful long hair. The hair products he uses are of the highest grade, made and supplied by the Shinra Company. He seems to use one whole bottle of both shampoo and conditioner every time he washes his hair. They are scented with thirteen kinds of perfumes, including Rose and Vanilla. Apparently, the scent in the air after Sephiroth tosses his hair changes daily!&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-'', a Sephiroth fangirl in Midgar mentions she would ""love to see him stripped to the waist"", referring to how he appears during the final scripted battle in ''Final Fantasy VII''.

In the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, Sephiroth retains his core design of silver hair and a black coat. His clothing is given red linings and is of different shape. His sleeves have small red wings, and he bears a dark blue and black wing over his right shoulder. He bears two additional wings underneath his coat in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', alluding to his [[Safer∙Sephiroth|boss form]] from ''Final Fantasy VII''. Unlike his other appearances, Sephiroth has blue eyes. Other characters comment he looks like [[Cloud Strife/Other appearances#Kingdom Hearts series|Cloud]], as the ''Kingdom Hearts'' incarnation is implied to be an embodiment of Cloud's inner darkness.

In ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008)|Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', [[Sephiroth (Dissidia PSP)|Sephiroth's]] design in his base outfit is similar to his ''Final Fantasy VII'' design. His pauldrons are changed to resemble [[Yoshitaka Amano]]'s artwork of him. His coat is closed by a belt as in [[Tetsuya Nomura]]'s design. Beneath his coat are two white sashes with lavender on the edges, referencing both Amano's artwork of Sephiroth and his wings as [[Safer∙Sephiroth]].

https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki,Squall Leonhart,"
[[File:Ff8-squall2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Squall's CG portrait.]]
A teenager with unruly brown hair and light blue eyes, Squall most often wears a black leather bomber jacket with a fur trim collar and a v-neck white shirt, black pants with three interconnecting red belts, and black boots and gloves. He has a silver stud in his left ear and wears a silver chain necklace with a Griever pendant and a matching ring. The only times Squall isn't wearing this particular outfit is when he's wearing his SeeD uniform or SeeD cadet uniform, which he only does if required to, and in flashbacks to his childhood days where he wears an orange loose shirt with several black horizontal stripes, teal jeans and gray shoes and white soles. Squall's gunblade of choice is the [[Revolver (Final Fantasy VIII)|Revolver]], of which he owns a customized version with Griever engraved on both sides. In a duel with his rival, [[Seifer Almasy]], both end up giving each other mirroring scars across the face.

On his guest appearance as a secret character in ''Chocobo Racing'', both his brown hair and light blue eyes were darker and his interconnecting red belts and the three black belts on the right side from his main outfit are brown. The color of his belts would later be adapted to his ''Dissidia'' appearance.

In ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008)|Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' Squall looks much as he did in ''Final Fantasy VIII'', but is given additional fur ruffles on his jeans, a sash partially covering his right leg, and a lion's head belt buckle, as well as a new shirt with a plunging v-neck collar. Also, his jacket is now slightly more fitted. His Griever necklace has a different design in the ending FMV.

Even though Squall's eyes are light blue in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''Dissidia Final Fantasy'', in a select few FMVs in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' Squall's eyes appear dark teal, and both his Final Fantasy Mini Arts figure and ''Dragon Quest &amp; Itadaki Street'' portable artwork have brown eyes. 

In the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, Squall changes his name to {{KHWiki|Leon}}, and is an adult with longer unruly hair. In the first ''Kingdom Hearts'', he wears a black short sleeve leather jacket with a red Griever emblem in the sides of his sleeves. He gains a black side belt and wears black magnum combat shoes. He also gains three red belts to his arms to match up his black gloves. This appearance becomes another one of his alternate costumes in ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'' and his second alternate costume in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]''. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Squall regains his hairstyle and bomber jacket from ''Final Fantasy VIII'', but the color scheme is navy instead of black and he retains the red griever emblems. In ''Kingdom Hearts III'', he looks like he does in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' though the three belts now switch to the left side.

In the game's North American and European manuals&lt;!--they're the same--&gt;, Squall's height was listed as 173&amp;nbsp;cm (5'8""). The Japanese manual shows his height as 177&amp;nbsp;cm (equivalent to 5'10""). This difference is due to a misconception of height conversion. 177&amp;nbsp;cm, Squall's original height, is 69.68 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, and if 69.68 inches is divided by 12, the result is 5.80, leading to the false conclusion of 5'8, when in fact there are 12 inches in a foot, not 10 (so .8 of a foot would equate 9.68 inches). The same error occurs with the other characters' proclaimed height as well. The game's official websites for the original and the [[Steam]] versions list Squall's height as 5'9"" (175&amp;nbsp;cm). The official websites for the ''Remastered'' version don't list heights.

He has a black tribal [[Tattoo (body modification)|tattoo]] on the left side of his face. The only time Zell doesn't wear his gloves is during the SeeD inauguration ball.

Zell is the shortest of the three playable male characters. In the original release Quistis is taller than him, but in ''Final Fantasy VIII Remastered'', his character model is now taller than hers.

He has white bands around his forearms and wears a large yellow beaded necklace. He wears a long pole in battle. In-game, the insignia on Raijin's shoulder guard is the kanji for ""thunder"", but in his FMV model, it reads the self-invented kanji for Raijin's name.

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts|Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Raijin wears a modern outfit as opposed to his primary outfit in the original and appears similar to a hip hopper. He wears an orange tank top with black designs on his shoulders, black trousers with two red linings and a number 8 embedded at the left side and yellow and white sneakers with black soles.

Quistis wears a salmon zipped vest, with a gold-rimmed fold-over collar, that is zipped just below the ribcage exposing her midriff. She wears brown arm warmers and brown gloves, a long salmon skirt with a silver waistband, black pants, a brown belt and brown shoes. She has blue eyes and wears her blond hair tied up held with a silver comb accessory, and has two long fringes framing her face. As an instructor in Balamb Garden she wears her [[SeeD#SeeD Uniform and Mannerisms|SeeD uniform]] and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses.

In the North American release Quistis's height was listed as 168 cm (5'6""), however, the ''[[Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania]]'', the latest edition of which was released seven years after the game's release, revised the height to 172cm (5'8""). This is because all character heights were converted wrong from their original metric values to the US customary system.

Quistis is one of the few playable characters in the series to wear glasses; the first was [[Tellah]] from ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', and others include [[Queen (Type-0)|Queen]] from ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'' and [[Ignis Scientia]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''.

In ''Final Fantasy X'', Yuna wears an ensemble similar to, but widely varied from, those worn by [[Yevon]]ites: a purple pleated, flower-patterned hakama; black boots; a black spaghetti-string camisole under a white sash that wraps around her neck and over her chest; and a yellow patterned ''[[wikipedia:Obi (sash)|obi]]'' with a ''chōchō musubi'' knot and a decorative ''obidome'' to clinch the cords. Two separate, [[wikipedia:Kimono|kimono-like]] pink and white sleeves secured by purple cords complete the outfit. The design of [[Yuna's Staff|her staff]] is based on the [[wikipedia:Khakkhara|Khakkhara]], a staff used by practitioners of Buddhism.

Yuna has shoulder-length brunette hair. She wears a blue-beaded earring on her right ear, hidden by a lock of her hair, woven into blue beads with gold rings around the larger, middle bead. She wears a silver necklace of a hibiscus flower along with a matching ring on the pinky of her right hand. She also wears a silver ring on the middle finger of her left hand and two bracelets, one beaded and one silver, on her right wrist. Yuna has heterochromia: her left eye is blue, while the right is green to represent her half-[[Al Bhed]] heritage, though without the characteristic spiral.

In ''Final Fantasy X-2'', two years later, Yuna has transformed with a new revealing dress style and a more adventurous personality. Yuna retains her beaded earring and silver hibiscus necklace, but her hair is cropped shorter, resembling Tidus's hairstyle, with a red braid hanging down to her ankles.

Yuna's attire changes for each dressphere, with details that distinguish her from [[Rikku]] and [[Paine]]. Yuna's default appearance is the [[Gunner (Final Fantasy X-2)|Gunner dressphere]], an outfit given to her by Rikku in ''[[Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm]]''. She dons a modified halter-neck top with the symbol of the [[Zanarkand Abes]] across the chest and a pink hood. She wears yellow armbands over her biceps, a black bracelet on her left wrist, and denim bootyshorts. She carries a pouch on her left hip over an ankle-length blue and white half skirt and wears laced knee-high boots. Wearing the Gunner dressphere in combat, she wields her signature [[Tiny Bee]] pistols.

In the other dresspheres, Yuna wields her original summoning [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Yuna's rods|staves]], the [[Celestial Weapon#Nirvana|Nirvana]], Tidus's [[Brotherhood (weapon)|Brotherhood]] and [[Caladbolg]] swords, a blue variant of Rikku's dagger blades, and [[Auron]]'s [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Blurry Moon|Blurry Moon]] katana. Her [[Playing card|deck]] theme for the [[Lady Luck (Final Fantasy X-2)|Lady Luck]] dressphere is spades and her [[Mascot]] dressphere is a [[Moogle (race)|moogle]]. Her special dressphere is [[Floral Fallal]] whose appearance is designed after the hibiscus flower; ''yuna'' is the Japanese name of the Sea Hibiscus, the flower on her ''obi'' and her skirt in ''Final Fantasy X''. In a bonus cutscene where the girls spend time in a hot spring in [[Mt. Gagazet]], Yuna wears a pink and cream halter bikini [[Bathing suit|swimsuit]].

Tidus has disheveled blond hair with spiky layers. His hair is brown in his childhood flashbacks. He wears the logo of his blitzball team, the [[Zanarkand Abes]], as a silver pendant, and the logo is also printed on his right trouser-leg. Tidus puts his own flair on the regular blitzball player's outfit by having one shorter and one longer trouser-leg, similar to his father Jecht, who wore a sash on his right side over a pair of shorts. Tidus wears yellow and black shoes, a gauntlet on his left hand and a black glove on the other, a yellow jacket with a white hood, and a blue pauldron and armor over his left arm. The dark dungaree-type outfit he wears over his other clothes is fastened with a black belt that has a metal chain.

In ''Final Fantasy X -Will-'', Tidus's artwork has aspects of Jecht's design, wearing a similar headband.

[[File:Rikku Menu.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait by Tetsuya Nomura|150px]]
Rikku is a slender and athletic teenage girl who has medium-length blonde hair in a high ponytail with two braids hanging down, decorated with orange feathers. Two shorter sections of hair part to her left and frame her face. A pair of bobby pins, one blue and one green, crisscross the left side. She also has the Al Bhed trademark green eyes with swirled pupils.

When first encountered aboard the [[Salvage Ship]], Rikku wears a full Al Bhed combat diving suit that conceals her identity. When she joins Yuna's pilgrimage and sheds the suit, she wears a pair of flared green dolphin shorts with an orange belt and an orange sleeveless tank-top with side straps and two long blue ribbons hanging from the back. She wears a pair of goggles around her neck, a pair of boots, a gauntlet and arm guard for her right arm, and a large protective forearm mitt for her left. Around her right thigh, she keeps a pouch for her alchemy materials and equipment. Rikku has yellow-painted fingernails. Despite carrying goggles around her neck and wearing them while salvaging and piloting [[Machina (Final Fantasy X)|machina]], Rikku never wears them again after taking them off on the [[Moonflow (Final Fantasy X)|Moonflow]].

Rikku's ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster|Final Fantasy X HD Remaster]]'' cutscene model lacks earrings.&lt;!-- any other changes? --&gt;

In ''Final Fantasy X-2'', Rikku wears her now longer hair loose and braided, tied atop her head, adorned with colorful beads, and held by a blue bandana. Rikku has unique outfits for each of the thirteen dresspheres used in combat, with details that distinguish her from [[Paine]] and Yuna. In her default look, the Thief dressphere, she wears a yellow g-string [[bathing suit|bikini]] and an olive green mini-skirt, carrying two pouches at her waist and wearing ruffle sleeves. A long yellow and red scarf hangs loosely around her neck. Wearing the Thief dressphere in combat, she wields two red dagger-like blades designed for rapid attacks.

In other dresspheres, she wields Yuna's [[Tiny Bee]] guns and summoning staves [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Yuna's Rods|El Dorado]] and [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Yuna's Rods|Spiked Rod]], as well as Tidus's [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Tidus's Swords|Crystal Sword]], [[Auron]]'s [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Auron's Katanas|Katana]] blade and his [[Celestial Weapon#Masamune|Masamune]] katana. Her deck theme for the [[Lady Luck (Final Fantasy X-2)|Lady Luck]] dressphere is clubs, and her [[Mascot]] dressphere is a [[Cait Sith]].

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts|Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Rikku's hairstyle remains unchanged, and her default Thief dressphere has minor changes: she wears a yellow tube top and an orange skirt with two yellow ribbons and white ruffle sleeves. Her long scarf is now red with an orange tint. She now wears white knee-high socks, and her boots are white with blue folded sleeves.

Rufus is a young man with short blond hair and blue eyes. He wears a similar outfit in all his appearances: a white business suit with a matching jacket over a black shirt. In ''[[Final Fantasy VII Remake]]'', many new details are added to his suit: his jacket is now folded over akin to a trench coat, and he wears a tie, with a dark gray dress shirt. He wears ''hakama''-styled pants; the pant legs have a fitted interior and a baggy exterior that skirts over with buttons down the front pleat. Belts drape around his wrists and waist akin to ''himo'' straps and overall suspenders, and several hang loosely over his long skirt. His weapon of choice is a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun.

For the majority of ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', Rufus covers himself with a long white sheet. His clothing is more simplified, and wears a white leisure suit with a white dress shirt over a black dress shirt, a leather cuirass-like waistcoat that doubles as a bandolier for his shotgun, and black leather dress shoes.

Edea is refined and ladylike, traits particularly evident during her [[Enthrall|possession]] when [[Ultimecia]] uses Edea's sophistication and physical beauty to beguile her enemies. She has long black hair and green eyes that are golden yellow when possessed by Ultimecia.

Normally she wears a modest black dress with little jewelry, but while possessed, Edea wears a purple skin-tight dress with a plunging neckline and feathers around the collar, a headpiece adorned with jewels and a metallic half-circle frame on her back with two long strips of sheer fabric hanging down each side. The metallic half-circle holding Edea's cape is similar to the one worn by [[Wrexsoul]] in ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. It only appears during FMV scenes and battles, and is not present in her field model.

Before revealing her face at the parade, Edea wears a red mask to conceal her identity. Her long hair is magically shortened or hidden under her headgear as seen during the cutscene. During close-ups of her face during [[Full motion video|FMVs]], white lines can be observed extending from the corner of her eye and cheek.

Rinoa's shoulder-length black hair features caramel highlights on both sides of her face. Her eyes are dark brown. When first met at the [[SeeD]] ball Rinoa wears an off-white halter dress, her signature necklace, a bracelet on her right wrist, and white shoes. She wears the ballroom outfit again at the [[Garden Festival]] event in [[Fishermans Horizon]]. The ballroom dress is her [[Alternate outfit|alternate costume]] in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]''.

Her signature outfit is a long, sleeveless, blue rib-knit duster sweater with a pair of white wing designs on the back. She wears matching rib-knit arm warmers, a black tank top, a denim button-up skirt, a black ribbon on her left arm, and black cycling shorts with zippers going down the front and a pair of silver-buckled black boots. Her necklace features a ring. Just before the [[Battle of the Gardens]] she receives Squall's [[Griever (Final Fantasy VIII)|Griever]] ring from [[Zell Dincht|Zell]], who borrowed it to make Rinoa a replica. Rinoa adds the Griever ring to her necklace and wears it along with her own. In the [[Adel (boss)|Adel boss battle]], Rinoa is not wearing her duster sweater, even though she has it in the scenes right before and after. 

In ''Dissidia Final Fantasy NT'', one of her alternate costumes on her primary attire is the color scheme of the SeeD uniform despite she was not a Garden student; her duster sweater is black, her tank top is white, and her denim mini-skirt is changed into red and black tartan-patterned skirt, and her arm warmers are gray. 

In the original North American release, Rinoa's height was listed as 161&amp;nbsp;cm (5' 3.5""), but the ''[[Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania]]'', the latest edition released seven years after the game, has her height as 163&amp;nbsp;cm (5' 4""). This is because the character heights were converted incorrectly from the metric to imperial for the North American version of ''Final Fantasy VIII''.

https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki,Kefka Palazzo,"
[[File:Amano Kefka II.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Artwork by [[Yoshitaka Amano]].]]
Kefka has long blond hair tied into a ponytail, worn with a feathered headdress. His face is painted white with red around his eyes and his lips are variably bright red or purple. He wears a large, ruffled collar that is primarily yellow with red stripes. His eyes are green.

In his original [[Final Fantasy VI concept art|concept art]], which has been used as the basis for his spin-off appearances, Kefka wears robes with an erratic mix of colors and patterns. The torso of his robes is a mash-up of white with pink polka-dots, black with yellow stripes, and plain purple. He wears a long red cloak with a yellow lining and red triangle trim along the interior and yellow and red tassels along the edge. Emerging from above his left shoulder is a mass of material in different patterns. The largest is white with red triangle trim, and with it are three more swatches of material; yellow with blue crown-like patterns, blue with red and white stripes and red trim, and the last is a solid green.

His left sleeve is red with an elbow-length yellow glove that fades to white at the wrist and has green accents along the fingers. His right sleeve is a puffed purple pattern with red polka-dots, and ends above the elbow at a yellow material. His glove is orange with a large cuff and white fingers and red claws, and white swirl patterns like flames emerge from under the cuff and run up his sleeve. His leggings are red, his left leg runs down to his boot, which is two-toned black with pink and gold lining, and the right leg has the red end above his knee over a single blue tight, and his boot is white with a black triangle trim and pink lining. Both his boots are pointed and curled. Finally, he has a yellow skirt wrapped around his waist and a red sash dangling over his right leg, which bears a pattern of black triangles with red lining and half-black, half-white spots.

Alternate concept arts depict Kefka in differently colored robes with different patterns. One such art {{Show image|Kefka Chibi II.jpg}} was used for the basis of Kefka's sprite as a boss in ''Final Fantasy VI'' and has influenced his design in some spin-off appearances; the primary differences between his usual appearance and this variant is his clothing features more white and pink, his leggings have white and black stripes, and his collar ruffle is white with alternating red and blue triangles instead of yellow with red stripes. Another concept art {{Show image|Kefka2.jpg}} that served as the basis for Kefka's field sprite in the Super NES release of ''Final Fantasy VI'' gives him robes in various shades of green and yellow with red on his right leg. His field sprite in the 2014 iOS and Steam releases is redesigned to bear a stronger resemblance to his concept art and battle sprites, giving him red and orange robes with a green belt, purple boots, and his cape has green spots along the edge and a larger green pattern along the back of his neck that resembles leaves. He also has a more vibrant shade of blonde hair. His ''Pixel Remaster'' sprite is refined to bear an even closer resemblance to his concept art. Kefka wears red robes with a green collar, a yellow and green belt, a red sash on his waist, one blue legging, purple boots, and a green and red cape. He also has a lighter skin tone than other characters to give the impression of his white make-up.
[[File:FFXIV Kefka concept.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Concept art of Kefka's god form for ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]''.]]
As the god of magic, the only remaining traits of Kefka's previous human form are his blond ponytail and feathered headdress. His skin is violet and he is bare save for a purple loincloth wrapped around his waist; the exact shade of his skin and loincloth vary between depictions. He is more muscular and in some depictions has a golden crest of swirls running along the center of his torso. Kefka has six wings in this form; the upper two pairs are feathered wings in a pale purple color, and the lower pair is a set of leather wings, black with a gradient purple lining. The central pair of feathered wings are much longer than the other two, and in some depictions Kefka's upper pair of wings merge with the middle pair.

Celes has long blonde hair and blue eyes. Her outfit varies considerably between her [[Final Fantasy VI concept art|concept arts]] and game sprites. In her artworks, Celes wears a rich gold-yellow vest with detached sleeves that run up to her biceps and pants of the same color. She wears white boots and a top under her vest that comes up to her collarbone—the top is colored black, blue, purple, or pink in different concept art, but in spin-offs is consistently a shade of blue-indigo. Her sleeves and pants are laced on her thigh and upper arm. In her game sprites, Celes wears a low-cut green leotard with a belt around her waist, armored shoulderpads connected to a white cape, and blue boots and wrist bangles. Spin-offs have used either of these two designs.

Celes is also strongly associated with the dress she wore when performing in the [[Opera ""Maria and Draco""]], an elaborate white gown with blue details, puffed shoulders, and a flared floor-length skirt with a blue ribbon around her waist. In this outfit Celes wears her hair tied with a blue ribbon.

Celes's signature weapon is a curved sword with a blue handle with a tassel and a golden crossguard with a swirl shape, one side curving up and the other down. {{Show image|Celes.jpg}}

[[File:Auron Menu.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Portrait by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]
Auron wears a red ''haori'' closed with a black and blue strap with two brown belts wrapped around it. Auron tucks his left arm into the front of his ''haori'', making it look like his arm is in a sling. He removes his left arm from the ''haori'' when fighting, but his right arm remains in its sleeve. This aspect (along with the jug on his side) is a tradition among ''rōnin'', wandering masterless samurai, and is likely an homage. He wears a black armored gauntlet on his right hand and an armor brace on his left forearm.

Auron wears a brown shoulder pad on his left shoulder intricately decorated with tan, green, and blue patterns with a beaded ornament dangling from it. He wears black pants and shoes that have brown straps and triangular metal plating. Auron wears a black shirt with a high gray collar with intersecting brown straps. His hair is black with gray streaks held back by a gold ribbon, and he has some stubble on his chin.

[[File:Young Auron Sketch.jpg|150px|thumb|Young Auron by Tetsuya Nomura.]]
Auron has a scar on the right half of his face over his eye, which remains shut as a result. His left eye is amber, and he wears black sunglasses. On his right hip, Auron carries a jug with the word ""Nog"" written on it (in [[Language#Final Fantasy X|Spiran script]]), a term used to describe some beverages, including rum. The drink is featured in two of his [[Overdrive (Final Fantasy X)|Overdrives]]: when executing [[Banishing Blade]], Auron takes a drink and spits it on the blade, and when using [[Bushido (Final Fantasy X)#Tornado|Tornado]], Auron hurls the jug into the cyclone to ignite it. The former is likely a homage to Japanese samurai who would spit sake on their swords to ""feed the spirit of the blade"".

In ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster|Final Fantasy X HD Remaster]]'', Auron's character model was remodeled so his skin would resemble more of a real-life mid-30s man. His hair was elongated and more disheveled, his shades have better transparency, and his clothing details are sharper.

{{spoiler}}
Auron was 25 when he became an unsent. While the other met unsent appear static, still appearing youthful even after hundreds of years, Auron has aged since his transition. Whether this is the pyreflies aging him accordingly or Auron's own choice to appear older is never explained.

Wakka is tall and muscled, with tan skin, brown eyes, and long reddish-orange hair styled into a coif and girted with blue headscarf. He wears the uniform of his blitzball team, the Besaid Aurochs, with alterations (presumably as he is the captain): a yellow vest top cut away at the stomach, a yellow shoulder pad on his left shoulder, blue and yellow baggy trousers gathered above the ankle, brown wristbands with a blue and yellow armguard over the left arm, and open sandals. He wears a dolphin necklace and has a silver stud earring on his left ear. In ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster|Final Fantasy X HD Remaster]]'', Wakka's model has been updated with detail added to his headscarf and hair. His face has been rounded and his skin, lips, beard, and eyes have been touched-up.

During ''Final Fantasy X-2'', Wakka has grown more lax in his lifestyle, and is said to have gained weight. Despite being called ""tubby"" by Rikku, the developers had not created a new character model for him, meaning this is not apparent.

[[File:Lulu Menu.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Portrait by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]
Lulu deviates from the ""traditional [[Black Mage (job)|Black Mage]] look"" like that of [[Vivi Ornitier]] by taking on inspirations from the traditional obeah voodoo priestess and a modern day witch known for their mysterious manner of clothing, as well as the use of voodoo dolls. She wears a low-cut dark-gray and black dress that displays her cleavage (from which she pulls out items when she uses the [[Item]] command), with two crossed belts on the upper part of each sleeve. The décolletage is trimmed in fur, and the hem and sleeves have ornate lace edges. The lower front of her gown is made of a collection of interlaced belts. She wears a corset and lace-trimmed thigh-high stockings. Her in-game models lack legs due to her attire, but in her 1/6 scale official figurine, she wears black strappy heels.

Lulu is one of few characters in the series to have a non-standard iris color: red. Her hair is braided in cornrows that lead into a bun and long braids, except for her long forelock: the braids are tied into a knot with four ornamented pins which may represent the four cardinal elements of black magic, and four bead-tipped braids fall from it. She wears many accessories: a necklace of purple round beads, a small one of white beads, and another of red and blue beads, rings and many earrings. She uses purple makeup and nail polish. Lulu's manner of dress is a stark contrast from the other residents of the tropical island. In fact, Lulu and [[Paine]] wear similar garments unique only to them in the entirety of Spira and are also the only characters seen with red irises.

Despite being nine months pregnant and giving birth during ''Final Fantasy X-2'', Lulu shows none of the physical tell-tale signs, even to the point Rikku says she ""doesn't look pregnant"". This is due to developers not wanting to create a new character model for her. Her outfit includes a corset, but in real life such a garment is dangerous to wear for someone who is pregnant.

Tseng dons the classic, dark blue Turk attire in ''Final Fantasy VII'', and wears a similar, but black suit in the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''Final Fantasy VII Remake''. He has dark brown eyes and shoulder-length, black hair occasionally tied in a ponytail. He wears what is known in Chinese culture as ''huadian'' in the center of his forehead, which is a type of traditional makeup technique.

Tseng removes his ponytail and lets his hair fall in ''Before Crisis -Final Fantasy VII-'' after [[Rufus Shinra]] spares Tseng from execution due to his perceived loyalty to the [[Shinra Electric Power Company]]. This is a token of deep dishonor in Chinese culture. In ''Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-'', when Tseng is ordering [[Cissnei]] to return the runaway [[Nibelheim]] ""specimens"" alive, his hair is up in his ''Crisis Core'' hairstyle, but when the scene switches to an FMV, his hair is down in his ''Final Fantasy VII'' hairstyle. It is implied Tseng has been promoted to the leader of the Turks for international players who have not played ''Before Crisis -Final Fantasy VII-''.

He wears a vest over an off-white undershirt, and gloves and pants that match his vest, and brown boots. His Amano concept art depict his clothes as black with blue lining, while his SD art and sprites have them as entirely blue. His bandana also varies in design and how he wears it; it is striped and worn over his hair in Amano's art and in his SD art it is smaller with no pattern and worn under his bangs. Locke's designs in spin-off appearances have used blue of various shades as well as black for his outfit and gone with varying designs for his bandana.

Some alternate concept art for Locke depicts him with a mustache, but he has never had one in-game in any title. He has also been depicted in art with a black top and no vest, with a white top and no vest and red pants, and with a pink vest and white pants. These outfits too have never been adapted to any other appearance.

During a segment of the game, Locke can wear [[disguise]]s, and don the guise of an Imperial [[Cadet (Final Fantasy VI)|cadet]] and a [[Merchant (Final Fantasy VI)|merchant]]. As a cadet Locke wears a green-tinted version of the standard issue Imperial soldier uniform, which includes a helmet with a visor, an armored chestplate, green trousers, and blue gloves and boots. As a merchant he wears thick brown robes with white sleeves, a blue turban that drapes to the shoulders, and blue boots.

Locke's weapon in concept art is a short, curved dagger with a notch on the inside of the blade near the hilt, which is yellow or gold. In spin-off appearances, whatever weapon Locke wields varies in specific details, but is universally some manner of curved knife.

He wears matching pants and brown boots, the latter of which are adorned with the same type of red orb as is on his belt. Leo has dark brown eyes and blonde hair cut in a flat top style. Leo's Super NES and Gameboy Advance sprites give him light green trim on his coat and blue pauldrons and boots.

In Leo's Super NES sprite, he has the same skin tone as most other human NPCs, but his portrait and concept art depict him with dark skin. This is likely due to technical limitations of the number of palettes player-characters can draw from and the limited number of colors they have. The 2014 mobile and Steam release, as well as the ''Pixel Remaster'' release, give Leo's sprite a darker tone, though not as dark as his portrait. All-spin off titles featuring Leo consistently depict him with dark skin, save for ''[[Final Fantasy Record Keeper]]'' which reuses Leo's SNES sprite.

Leo's personal weapon is a sword. In ''Final Fantasy VI'' he wields the [[Crystal Sword (Final Fantasy VI)|Crystal Sword]]. His concept art does not give a full view of the sword, only the handle and end of the sheath; what can be made out is that the handle is blue ornamentation and the blade is curved.

He wears black shorts and yellow boots with high footings. His sword has a black hilt and light blue to black blade.

[[Maechen]] implies Shuyin's resemblance to Tidus is more than coincidental, but what he means by this is not made explicit. It is possible that the fayth summoning [[Dream Zanarkand]] ""dreamed"" Tidus in an attempt to recreate what they remembered of Shuyin, as they were charged with remembering and preserving every aspect of the destroyed city.

Introduced as a seven-year-old girl, Rydia wears a yellow skirt and white cloak over a gray bodysuit. Her clothes are blue in her sprites, while they are black in [[Yoshitaka Amano]]'s artwork of her, and dark green in her 3D remake model. Following her return as a young woman, Rydia wears a green outfit with knee-high golden heeled boots and draperies adorned in stars. This outfit was a straight leotard in the original version but was changed in the 3D remake, closer resembling the original Amano design. Rydia is one of a few characters to undergo a permanent physical change with her sprite and [[Menu (Final Fantasy IV)|menu]] portrait changing as well. Other characters to do this are Cecil, Kain, [[Garnet Til Alexandros XVII|Dagger]] from ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', and [[Basch fon Ronsenburg|Basch]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.

During ''Final Fantasy IV: The After Years'', Rydia's attire is a single-piece green bodysuit that rises from her thighs to her collar, baring her hips and upper torso. The overseas releases [[Censorship|censored]] her artwork, which included a green skirt, and covered the exposed areas of her body; the same was done with [[Porom]] and [[Ursula]], but Rydia's artwork received the most censorship.

[[File:FFT Ramza CG Render.png|left|150px|CG Render of Ramza from ''War of the Lions''.]]
Ramza has long blond hair with a full fringe and a distinctive single bang on his head and is tied in a low ponytail and brown eyes. As an Order of the Northern Sky squire he wears a set of armor over a blue long-sleeved tunic meant to signify his nobility as a Beoulve, and a white cape (though this is not shown on his in-game sprite). In ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]'', his Chapter 1 appearance serves as his main outfit and it can choose in two color palettes. He is also depicted in a more realistic visual style, entailing greater definition being given to his facial structure compared to his depictions in the more cartoon-like visual style of ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.

After becoming a mercenary he cuts his hair and wears a dark purple, heavy armor plating on his torso, elbows and shoulders with two spikes on each shoulder protector. Underneath he wears a black leather turtle-neck that covers the wrists of his leather gloves over white gauntlets. He wears white, plated, long boots with two spikes on each knee protector over leather trousers. In the CGI cel-shaded scenes, he is depicted based on his official art. In ''Dissidia Final Fantasy NT'', his Mercenary outfit becomes his first alternate costume and it can also choose in two color palettes.

In the final [[chapter]] Ramza's shoulders, elbows, forearms, hands, legs, and feet are plated in a cyan armor. The shoulder protectors have an oval hole on the inside of a thick, black fabric. His elbow protectors are worn outside of the black garment, along with his arm and hand protectors worn over leather gloves. The black fabric has an appliqué of a white bull's head on the chest. The legs are supported by a leather strapped girdle with a gold buckle holding groin and thigh suspenders, worn over white leather pants. The lower leg and feet protectors are worn over brown boots. This outfit is not seen in the CGI cel-shaded cutscenes of the ''Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions'' remake, where he retains his mercenary outfit from chapters 2 and 3. In ''Dissidia Final Fantasy NT'', Ramza's Chapter 4 appearance became his second alternate costume and it can be chosen in two color pallettes. Only the head of the white bull at the center of his black fabric was changed into a head of a white goat with longer horns resembling [[Adrammelech (Tactics)|Adrammelech]]'s white shadowed appearance.

https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki,Dark King,"
The Dark King initially appears as massive, green-skinned man wearing a red, white fur-trimmed robe with a gold rope fastener. In the Japanese version, the ""rope"" is a thread of jewels with tufts of fur at the end. He wears purple robes with white linings, and a gold crown. He holds a gold and silver scepter with a red orb on top (in the Japanese version, the scepter is curved and has a cobra head-like mounting and a skull). He has blank white eyes (red in the Japanese artwork). Although not present in either the in-game sprite or the European artwork, his Japanese artwork depicts him with tufts of white hair and a purple belt with gold linings and three red jewels, and with long fingernails.

[[File:Ffmq_dark_king.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese artwork.]]
His crown has some differences between the versions: in the Japanese artwork, the Dark King's crown is gold with a red fabric top and gold lines and multi-colored jewels. It resembles to the Georgian Crown as worn by King George XII. The European artwork depicts it as having at least four square ridges, a central red jewel and multiple jewels of differing colors on the sides. The in-game sprite is similar to the latter, although it has three red jewels and three ridges. Similarly, his face in the sprite and European artwork depict him with a thick imposing face, while in the Japanese artwork his is more gaunt.

Upon first transforming, the Dark King gains two additional pairs of arms, each with white hands with two fingers and a thumb (with the exception of his upper right hand, which still has green skin). He ditches the scepter, instead wielding several weapons: he holds a battle axe on his lower right arm, a rapier on his middle left arm, a longsword with a golden handle and a red jewel in the center on his upper right arm, a katana on his upper left arm, a cutlass sword on his middle left arm, and a bow and arrow on his lower left arm. His robe is sprawled open, revealing his purple robes in full as well as a gold wheel-like ornament on his chest. His face becomes more demonic, showing two large white pincers coming out of his mouth, and gaining two white horns.

He then transforms into a spider where he has a green face, serrated pincers at his mouth, four fangs, curved white horns, two large white eyes, and six smaller white eyes and antenna. His body becomes gold, gray and red and resembles a tarantula with red markings on his abdomen. He has primarily yellow legs and red tips, and white hairs near the tips of each leg. He implies this is his true form.

The Dark King's final form is similar to the third form with red eyes. Most of the hairs have turned green as well as the antennae, and his legs have been reduced to writhing red tentacles, with two of them partially amputated.

In ''Final Fantasy III'', the Cloud of Darkness appears as a green-skinned female humanoid that emerges from a portal of darkness at its waist, though its form appears ghostly and ethereal. It has a red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, and several mouthed tentacles around it. Its field sprite is a glowing green orb, and in the 3D remakes, several multiple green orbs exit and enter the main orb in an arc.

In [[Yoshitaka Amano]]'s illustration and ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', the Cloud of Darkness takes the form of a shapely woman wearing a red and black cape with the rest of its body covered in red and black markings. It has a red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, long silver hair and two tentacles emerging from its waist. The Cloud of Darkness is the tallest non-giant character in the ''Dissidia'' series.

Though the Cloud of Darkness universally takes on a feminine form, it is officially considered a genderless being that merely chooses to appear as such. The Cloud of Darkness refers to itself in the plural, using ""We"" instead of ""I"". ''Dissidia Final Fantasy'' explains this as its two tentacles having minds of their own, and the humanoid body speaking for the three of them. For purposes of gameplay, however, the Cloud of Darkness is treated as female in its spin-off series appearances, and is therefore able to equip [[female-exclusive equipment]]. A feedback survey issued by the ''[[Final Fantasy Record Keeper]]'' team also referred to the Cloud of Darkness as female, and so grouped it with other female characters asking which was the ""coolest"" among the group.

Firion was designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], whose artworks of Firion vary, but his appearance has been refined through ports of the original game and his appearance in spin-offs. His original NES sprite was a modified [[Warrior (Final Fantasy)|Warrior]] sprite from the first ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Later ports of the game depict Firion with long silver hair tied in a ponytail and covered by a blue, orange, and yellow bandana, and he has brown eyes. He wears lightweight red, orange, and yellow armor with blue bracers and shinguards. Concept art depicts Firion with a cape of various colors, and his ''Dawn of Souls'' art gives him a red-orange cape. Prototype screenshots for the [[WonderSwan Color]] version of ''Final Fantasy II'' show Firion with a cape{{citation needed}}, but he did not have one in-game until the Playstation Portable ''20th Anniversary'' port.

The details of Firion's appearance vary across different concept arts of him, with the major constants being long silver hair with a bandana, light armor, and a cape. For his appearance in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008)|Dissidia]]'', Firion was redesigned by [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. Firion retails his silver hair and tri-colored bandana, but his outfit is primarily light blue with darker blue or black details, and he has a blue cape. This design has become the basis for Firion's design in most spin-off appearances, though some appearances instead base him on his sprite designs with red and orange armor, and on other occasions his cape may be red or orange instead of blue.

Firion's signature weapon is the [[Crimson Sword]], which appeared in his original concept arts. It is a bright red blade with a curved tip and a red tassel. A variant of the weapon has appeared under the name [[Blood Sword (weapon)|Blood Sword]]; this originates from ''Dissidia'' where Firion's weapons became [[Blood equipment|Blood weapons]] and turned a deeper hue of red in his [[EX Mode]].

[[File:Dissidia 012 Gilgamesh Ingame Render.png|right|thumb|200px|Gilgamesh in ''Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy'', based on his Yoshitaka Amano concept art.]]
Gilgamesh's appearance is usually that of a male with a stout stature, wearing red and orange armor of varying design, and having as many as eight arms, each of which holds one of his many weapons. He wears face paint that is white or grey with red markings, but other times this is actually his real skin complexion. Gilgamesh usually only has two arms visible, but when he reveals his true form he has six or eight arms (the exact number is inconsistent between different games). In ''Final Fantasy IX'' he has four arms at all times, and in ''Final Fantasy XV'' he has only one arm, but forms another of pure energy as the fight with him progresses.

Most commonly in spin-off titles, Gilgamesh's appearance is based on his original appearance in ''Final Fantasy V'', which was designed by Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura, who also designed Gilgamesh's battle sprite in that game. In this design, Gilgamesh wears red-orange armor with with a grey steel chestplate, grey pants with polka-dots with multiple layered skirts, a belt with a monstrous face on the clasp, a helmet with a pair of black horns and a tassel, and black and gold bracers and boots. The exact details may change depending on if either Amano's or Nomura's art is used as the basis; for instance, Amano's design gives Gilgamesh bright red armor while Nomura's design is more orange, and Nomura's design has a more prominent chestplate than Amano's design.

Gilgamesh's trademark weapon is a ''naginata'', a type of polearm. He otherwise uses many different weapons in different games, with the four most common being Excalibur, Excalipoor, [[Zantetsuken (weapon)|Zantetsuken]], and [[Masamune (weapon)|Masamune]]. The exact design of these weapons also varies between games.

Cecil wears dark armor that covers his body and face while he is a Dark Knight (the 3D render shows his eyes). When he becomes a Paladin, Cecil wears a blue and white armor that reveals his appearance: shoulder-length white hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and a tinge of purple on his lips.

In ''Final Fantasy IV: The After Years'', Cecil wears a suit of white armor, but with dark spikes on the knees and pauldrons, and a brown cloak with blue stripes around the neck.

Cecil is one of the few ''Final Fantasy'' characters who are mixed-race, along with [[Yuna]], [[Golbez]], [[Terra Branford]], [[Aerith Gainsborough]], [[Seymour Guado]], [[Lilisette]], and [[Hilda Ware|Hilda]]. Cecil is the first half-human main protagonist.

[[File:FF8 Ultimecia.png|left|250px]]
Ultimecia wears a skin-tight red gown with a plunging neckline that exposes her neck, chest, stomach and abdomen, and only partially obscures her breasts. A black collar extends down the neckline to her waist; the collar rests over her shoulders and covers the junction of her black feathered wings. In ''Final Fantasy VIII'' the collar appears to be made of feathers, but in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008)|Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' it is made of fur. The dress has a short train, which drags along the floor, trimmed either similarly to the collar, or torn and frayed and made dirty. Long red sleeves with prominent shoulder pads join with her purple taloned hands.

Ultimecia's skin is [[Tattoo (body modification)|tattooed]] or body-painted with lined patterns. She wears a gold necklace, earrings and hair jewelry among a headdress designed to pull her hair up to resemble horns; silver bangs are left to frame her face. Ultimecia has yellow eyes surrounded by purple eyeshadow and she wears deep red lipstick. She has no eyebrows, instead having tattoos. She doesn't wear shoes, walking (or perhaps flying) barefoot, and although Ultimecia has a human appearance, her toenails resemble a beast's claws and are accentuated in her ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' appearance.

{{spoiler}}
While possessing [[Edea Kramer|Edea]], she dresses in a skin-tight dress with a plunging neckline and a feathered collar, and wears an ornamental frame on her back with strips of gauze fluttering behind her, somewhat mimicking the appearance of Ultimecia's wings. During the possession, Edea's eyes change color from green to yellow.

Upon [[Ultimecia (Griever form)|junctioning herself into Griever]], Ultimecia takes on [[Griever (Final Fantasy VIII)|Griever's]] traits: lion-like head and front paws, a feathered lower half and a plated tail. Ultimecia herself stays below the leonine head with purple limbs. As she starts to [[Ultimecia (final boss)|become one with the universe]] Ultimecia's empty shell takes over while her bondaged human remains hang upside down from where her legs should be. Her ""face"" is but a glowing orb that blinks while she speaks. She has bat-like wings at the top of her head and elongated clawed arms. She wears flowing red robes with red-and-blue veins.

Snow has light blond hair, blue eyes, and a stubble beard. He wears a black bandanna, black gloves, large gray boots, a light blue vest over a black shirt, and a striped blue scarf hanging from a belt. He wears a beige trench coat with frayed hems that functions as his weapon as it is fused with [[Antimatter Manipulation Principle]] (AMP) technology. Snow wears a cat pendant, the logo of NORA. Snow's foot size is 33 centimeters (about a foot long). His [[l'Cie]] brand is on his left forearm and his [[eidolith]] crystal is in the shape of a heart.

In ''Final Fantasy XIII-2'', Snow's attire has darkened. He no longer wears his bandanna, vest or scarf, and has a shorter beard and slightly longer hair. He wears a dark red shirt under a dark gray trench coat with frayed hems. His hair is swept back and exposes his ears. He bears a new l'Cie brand from the [[Pulse]] fal'Cie [[Cactuar (fal'Cie)|Cactuar]] on his left arm, closer to his elbow than his original brand. It is in its fourth stage.

During ''Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII'', Snow has straight, layered, shoulder-length hair and a short beard. He wears a formal black suit conveying his change into a harsh and serious character. His l'Cie brand is hidden by his sleeve and advanced to its thirteenth stage, though it sometimes glows through the fabric. The only elements that have remained from his previous look are his gloves, [[engagement necklace|engagement pendant]] (even though he had given it to Serah in ''Final Fantasy XIII-2'' and she never returned it), and boots (albeit in a darker color). During his first battle with Lightning, he freezes the axe of an [[Anubys (Lightning Returns)|Anubys]] for himself to wield, but it is destroyed by Lightning during their fight.

As a [[Cie'th]] his eyes turn red, his lower left arm is encased in crystal, and the skin leading up from that arm turns black. As the battle with him progresses, the crystalline growth covers his entire arm and begins to consume his face. If fought [[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII days|on a later day]], he is shirtless after transforming and the growth on his arm is larger even before his transformation progresses.

Snow is the only main character to be a l'Cie in all three games of the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' trilogy.

{{Quote|Serah is Lightning's younger sister and Snow's fiancée.

In fact, Serah spends just as much time worrying about her elder sister's well-being as Lightning does Serah's.|Booklet Description}}
Serah is an 18-year-old girl with the same pink tint of hair Lightning has. She ties her hair into a ponytail on the left side of her head, much like how Lightning's hair drapes over her left shoulder. Serah has blue eyes like Lightning, although Serah's are a darker shade.

She wears cat-shaped earrings representing [[NORA]], a rebel group led by her fiancé, and a black armband on her right bicep and a bandage on her left bicep to cover her l'Cie brand. Her outfit consists of a red plaid-pleated skirt lined with black lace, a white sleeveless dress shirt, a semi-transparent pink sweeper vest, an extra matching hair tie on her left wrist, black thigh-high stockings with a white diamond shape attached to the top of her left stocking, and ivory ankle boots. She wears an [[Engagement necklace|engagement pendant]] shaped like Cocoon after receiving it from Snow. The engagement pendants resemble the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' logo {{Show image|Final Fantasy XIII Logo.jpg|''Final Fantasy XIII'' logo}}.

[[File:Serah Farron Alt Render.png|250px|right|Alternate render used in the menu screen.]]
In ''Final Fantasy XIII-2'', now 21 years old, Serah wears a revealing white, reddish-pink, and gold form-fitting dress. It has a white top, pink sections on the front and back connecting the top to the skirt over black shorts, cut-out sides at the waist, crisscrossing pink straps on the sides of her torso, and two straps that go over her shoulders into a cross-back shape. She wears a storage pack on her right hip that hangs from her waist, pink and black thigh-high leggings, and purple ankle boots. The outfit mysteriously appears on her while she sleeps before the first [[Paradox (Final Fantasy XIII-2)|paradox]] manifests.

Serah retains her earrings and engagement necklace and wears a pink choker, short pink sleeves under gray gloves that have gold ornaments, and gold armbands, one in the shape of a bird resting on her left bicep where her l'Cie brand used to be. Similar to Lightning's use of a [[Gunblade (weapon type)|gunblade]] that can switch between gun and sword, Serah wields a bowsword, though its true form is that of her new [[Moogle (race)|moogle]] companion, [[Mog (Final Fantasy XIII-2)|Mog]]. The symbol on the front of Serah's dress is also on Lightning's shield. [[Language#Etro script|Etro script]] is written on both symbols, the blades of Serah's weapon, the back of her dress, and her storage pack. The script on Serah's outfit translates to: ''Witness to Times Forgotten — Restorer of Lines Disjointed''.

In her CG render for ''Final Fantasy XIII-2,'' Serah's ponytail is held by a pink band matching her outfit, but in-game, she retains the black band she wore in ''Final Fantasy XIII''.

Her [[Crystal (term)#Final Fantasy XIII|crystal]] is in the shape of a teardrop that Snow holds onto for most of the story in ''Final Fantasy XIII''.

Art Director [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]] consistently draws Serah and Lightning with blonde hair in concept art, despite their more ""official"" appearance. Additionally, Kamikokuryo's Serah concept art for ''Final Fantasy XIII-2'' looks older and less skinny than her in-game appearance. A few details on her outfit are also different (such as a different choker).

He wears a red bandanna, a metal gauntlet on his left arm, and carries a large black sword.  Alluding to his form as the Fianl Aeon, he has clusters of spikes emerging from under his sash and from his left shoulder.

In ''Dissidia'', Jecht's alternate outfit turns his sash and spikes red, and his sword gains red colorings with gold details, a reference to [[Auron]]'s color scheme. {{Show image|Auron_Art.png}} This alternate outfit is removed in ''Dissidia 012'' and replaced with a new alternate outfit that more closely matches Jecht's ''Final Fantasy X'' design. Jecht's clothing is no longer torn, his sash has a lighter color gradient, he bears no spikes, and his gauntlet and hair are differently designed. His EX Mode remains identical between the two outfits, a primarily green Final Aeon with purple claws and orange trimmings on the edge of his leg sash. Jecht's first alternate outfit in ''Dissidia'' is unnamed{{note|The first ''Dissidia'' did not name its alternate outfits.}}, and his first alternate outfit in ''Dissidia 012'' is called ""Road Uni"".

Jecht's second alternate outfit is named ""Abes Uni"" based on the Zanarkand Abes uniform as seen in the ''Final Fantasy X'' introductory sequence. {{Show image|FFX Zanarkand Abes Player.png}} His shorts are longer with a gray and black pattern, he wears blue and black coverings over his lower arms, and has a darker headband. His Final Aeon spikes and the cloth over his leg are absent, and he remains shirtless and barefoot. This is Jecht's attire in ''Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy'' as a warrior of Cosmos and in the opening FMV. His EX Mode is a dark purple Final Aeon with orange claws, meant to resemble the Final Aeon as it appeared when being empowered by the [[Yu Pagoda]]s. {{Show image|Braska's-final-aeon-with-yu-pagodas-ffx.jpg}} His shorts in his Final Aeon form are shorter to match the length of his shorts in his other outfits, but retain the gray and black coloring.

I am surprisingly tall for my age. I'm constantly being told: ""you're so tall!"" It can get annoying sometimes. I have blonde hair that would cover my eyes if I didn't brush it to the side. It's rather messy and not really controlled at all, and if you try to brush it or make it look neater it only makes it worse. My hair is about average length, I don't really know how to describe the length other than average. I'm also very skinny. My dad always says I need to build some muscle, but I'm perfectly happy just not being fat. No matter what season it is I'm ''always'' wearing pants/shorts of the darkest navy blue color I can find. My shirts tend to have sleeves just long enough to pass as a short-sleeved shirt and not a tank top. They're usually either black or white. I don't wear many different colored shirts. That doesn't mean I don't have ''any'' colored shirts, because believe me I do, I just don't wear them as much. I'm always wearing a belt. It isn't because my pants are too big. On occasion that's why I'm wearing it, but as I told you before: I'm tall, and getting taller as we speak. My mom has to constantly keep buying me new pants. I always had to wear a belt because since I grow so fast she usually buys them a little big so we can buy them less often... It never works. Regardless, I wore the belt so much it became a habit, and now it's just always on. Last, my shoes never change: Black Converse High Tops. I hate them... a lot, but I can't seem to stop buying them. They're a pain to put on and there is always a wrinkle in my sock that I can never fix. I just keep getting them though. I think I'm attached to them... I don't know.

{{Quote|You want her? Then you're gonna have to go through me!|Noel, saving Serah when they meet}}
[[File:Noel portrait.png|thumb|left|Noel Kreiss.]]
Noel is an 18-year-old man with shoulder-length brown hair and blue eyes. When [[Ultros (Final Fantasy XIII-2)|Ultros]] sees Serah, he states that he likes girls pretty, but that Noel is even prettier. He wears a black V-neck top with tribal patterns and a print of angel wings on the back, along with a simple pendant. He wears a leather bracer on his left arm, a ring on his right hand, and wraps his right arm with cord. He wears large blue [[wikipedia:sirwal|sirwal]]-style trousers with decorated hems, and low-cut sandal-like leather boots. A green pouch and hunter's knife are attached to his belt in the back, which is adorned with small lavender cloth ties. Under the angel wings on the back of Noel's top and on his dagger, there are lines in [[Language#Etro script|Etro script]]. The script on his top translates to: ''Seeker of Miracles at History's End — Walker of the Realm Unseen'', and the text on the dagger reads: ''Travel the desolate wasteland in search of hope's past''.

Noel's sword set is called Flame Fossil. The sword he wields in his right hand has two bladed prongs stylized like red flames, complete with a silver holster with angel wings meant to hold his smaller sword. The holster is placed on one side of the bigger sword, vertically aligned in-between the prongs via a sliding mechanism. The sword he wields with his left hand is a simple yellow-brown blade similar to a gladius. The swords combine into a spear via the prongs bending to form a spearhead due to their sections being connected by rivets along with the sheath being pulled-back along the said sliding mechanism; the said sheath itself also extends an inner-layered-holster allowing the shorter sword to be fully inserted as the shaft-ended-half of the spear (likely to prevent Noel's hands from being cut should he hold the spear from there).

In ''Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII'', Noel's clothing and weapons remain the same in basic design, but his overall color scheme has darkened and has more subdued colors, likely to reflect his change in attitude (along with having a scar above his left cheek just below towards the far end of his eye socket). His sword set is now called ""Shadow Hunter"", a black palette swap of Flame Fossil with white patterns in its contrast. If the player waits until after [[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII days#Day 8|Day 8]] to fight Noel, he wears his Battle Attire outfit from ''Final Fantasy XIII-2''.&lt;!-- Do we know something about the ""Endless Paradox"" weapon? --&gt;

He has shoulder-length white hair, which was first mentioned in ''Tales from the Dragonsong War'', and later shown in-game following the end of the Dragonsong War.

During the battle with Nidhogg in the Aery, Estinien's armor is severely scratched up and loses a horn before it is stained crimson in a shower of the dragon's spilled blood. This is a catalyst of blood magic, completed when Estinien takes hold of both of Nidhogg's eyes, where his most ""human"" form shows red glowing veins on his face and the two eyes fused to his mail. Parts of his lance become blood red, and its blade becomes jagged and claw-like. He later names his weapon after his late arch-nemesis.

Nyx is a young man with dark gray hair and blue eyes. He wears the black uniform typical of his fellow Glaives, but his is customized with a silver antler or horn on its hood, purple ribbons on its back, and pelts of blue-gray fur on its left sleeve. According to the ''[[The Art &amp; Design of Final Fantasy XV]]'' book, the ornament indicates his heritage as a member of an ancient lineage of hunters, and posits that it adds credibility to his role as a royal guard.

Nyx's signature weapon is [[Ulric's Kukris|his pair of kukris]], one originating from Galahd and the other having been forged in Insomnia, symbolizing both of his homelands.

Nyx has small and subtle [[Tattoo (body modification)|tattoos]]. He has a ""crow's foot"" on his right cheek, and a line and a dot under his left eye. He has markings on his ears, intersecting lines down his neck, one around his right shin and another around his left forearm. He also has a line down his middle finger of his left hand, and another down his forefinger on his right hand. Although they can't be seen in the movie, a video showing a rotating 3D model of how his hair was rendered shows the tops of two tattoos on his back; two sets of intersecting lines, one over each shoulderblade.

Nyx appears with a large feline in some illustrations. It is a Galahd-native coeurl and Nyx's image-motif. Horns and fur on his gear symbolize him being wild and also foreign, as he is an immigrant from Galahd, thus from a different culture compared to Insomnia. His theme color is blue to complement Regis, whose purple theme reflects his nobility and maturity. To show Nyx's youth and to make it in line with Regis's purple, blue was chosen to be Nyx's color.&lt;ref name","dark gray hair and blue eyes the black uniform typical of his fellow Glaives horn on its hood purple ribbons on its back, and pelts of blue-gray fur on its left sleeve a ""crow's foot"" his hair the tops of two tattoos fur on his gear"

He wears a white frock with black lining with a large collar that has a purple trim, and armored boots. Black downward-pointing sword symbols are found on the hem and sleeves of his coat, as well as a large crest with a unicorn of what is assumed to be the crest of either Tenebrae or House Fleuret, as Lunafreya also wears it on her casual dress. Ravus's crest has crossed swords underneath, which may represent his military service.

Ravus shares the trait of having heterochromia with [[Yuna]] from ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', though in ''Kingsglaive'' both of his eyes are gray. The change in eye color may have been caused by the same incident that burned his arm.

He is a man in mid 20s with a youthful face, fair complexion, and long golden hair. In the later patches of ''Shadowbringers'' and in ''Endwalker'', Zenos abandons his bulky suit of armor for lighter leather royal garments and a gold pauldron that extends from his right shoulder down to his arm. When merged with his avatar, his left arm glows red and becomes clawed, his hair flares out and darkens with glowing crimson streaks, and his eyes glow red, distinct from his Resonant eyes.

His weapons of choice are a set of three katanas: the Storm, the Swell, and Ame-no-Habakiri. The Storm and the Swell are lightning- and wind-aspected, respectively. Each sword has a distinct glow: purple for the Storm, green for the Swell, and red for Ame-no-Habakiri. Before acquiring Ame-no-Habakiri, he wielded an unnamed katana bearing the sigil of Garlemald. He carries the katanas in a ""sword revolver"", prominent throughout promotional materials. The revolver has been compared in appearance to a golf bag and even has a kickstand for when not in use. He later discards his katanas in favor of a scythe outfitted with a gun barrel at the blade's base.

In ''Endwalker'', Zenos changes his job to a Reaper. He wears a black and red assemble with half-cape, golden gauntlets and sabatons, wielding a gigantic [[magitek]] scythe. Like all Reapers, Zenos has a Voidsent Avatar, his distinct from the adventurer's; depicted as a tall, robed multi-armed figure covering its eyeless faces with its hands. Floating atop its head is a broken halo-like construct and wields its own scythe separate from Zenos's. When Zenos uses Enshroud, unlike the players where their Avatar envelops their whole bodies, Zenos's appearance only changes slightly. His hair darkens and stands up with red highlights, his body is shrouded with red and black spikes, and he has red eyes.

In [[Royal Menagerie|The Royal Menagerie]] Zenos can fuse with Shinryu, assuming the primal's form. When assisting the Warrior of Light in their last battle against the Endsinger, Zenos again assumes the form of Shinryu.

His extra alternate costume is ""'''Legatus of the XIIth'''"", similar to his default appearance though now donning his helmet, as seen in promotional art and in-game throughout ''Stormblood''.

The mouth and nose of the mask match the color of his burgundy armor, while the forehead and eyes are white with a skull-like motif and a large orb on the forehead, matching the same one on Zenos's forehead. His voice is also slightly modified to sound more metallic and muffled, as in the original game.

[[File:Yuna - Portrait.png|150px|left]]
In ''Final Fantasy X'', Yuna wears an ensemble similar to, but widely varied from, those worn by [[Yevon]]ites: a purple pleated, flower-patterned skirt; black boots; a black spaghetti-string camisole under a white sash that wraps around her neck and over her chest; and a yellow patterned ''[[wikipedia:Obi (sash)|obi]]'' with a ''chōchō musubi'' knot and a decorative ''obidome'' to clinch the cords. Two separate, [[wikipedia:Kimono|kimono-like]] pink and white sleeves secured by purple cords complete the outfit. The design of [[Yuna's Staff|her staff]] is based on the [[wikipedia:Khakkhara|Khakkhara]], a staff used by practitioners of Buddhism.

Yuna has shoulder-length brunette hair. She wears a blue-beaded earring on her right ear, hidden by a lock of her hair, woven into blue beads with gold rings around the larger, middle bead. She wears a silver necklace of a hibiscus flower along with a matching ring on the pinky of her right hand. She also wears a silver ring on the middle finger of her left hand and two bracelets, one beaded and one silver, on her right wrist.  Yuna has heterochromia: her left eye is blue, while the right is green to represent her half-[[Al Bhed]] heritage, though without the characteristic spiral.

In ''Final Fantasy X-2'', two years later, Yuna has undergone a transformation with a new revealing dress style and a more adventurous personality. Yuna retains her beaded earring and silver hibiscus necklace, but her hair is cropped shorter, resembling Tidus's hairstyle, with a red braid hanging down to her ankles.

Yuna's attire changes for each of the [[dressphere]]s, with details that distinguish her from [[Rikku]] and [[Paine]]. Yuna's default appearance is the [[Gunner (Final Fantasy X-2)|Gunner dressphere]], an outfit given to her by Rikku in ''[[Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm]]''. She dons a modified halter-neck top with the symbol of the [[Zanarkand Abes]] across the chest and a pink hood. She wears yellow armbands over her biceps, a black bracelet on her left wrist, and denim boyshorts. She carries a pouch on her left hip over an ankle-length blue and white halfskirt and wears laced knee-high boots. Wearing the Gunner dressphere in combat, she wields her signature [[Tiny Bee]] pistols.

In the other dresspheres, Yuna wields her original summoning [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Yuna's Rods|staves]], the [[Celestial Weapon#Nirvana|Nirvana]], Tidus's [[Brotherhood (weapon)|Brotherhood]] and [[Caladbolg]] swords, a blue variant of Rikku's dagger blades, and [[Auron]]'s [[Final Fantasy X weapons#Blurry Moon|Blurry Moon]] katana. Her deck theme for the [[Lady Luck (Final Fantasy X-2)|Lady Luck]] dressphere is spades and her [[Mascot]] dressphere is a [[Moogle (race)|moogle]]. Her special dressphere is [[Floral Fallal]] whose appearance is designed after the hibiscus flower; ''yuna'' is the Japanese name of the Sea Hibiscus, the flower on her ''obi'' and her skirt in ''Final Fantasy X''. In a bonus cutscene where the girls spend time in a hot spring in [[Mt. Gagazet]], Yuna wears a pink and cream halter bikini [[Bathing suit|swimsuit]].

Harry Potter is a near-spitting image of [[James Potter I|his father]], having jet black, untidy hair, although with brilliant green eyes that are identical to those of his [[Lily Evans|his mother]]. Harry's physique as a boy was described as ""small and skinny"", with a thin face and knobbly knees, due to his poor quality of life in his childhood. In time he would grow to be ""within an inch"" of his father's height, and James was often described as tall. He wears round-rimmed glasses. Upon his forehead, covered by his unruly black hair, is a scar shaped like a lightning bolt. The scar is a result of the failed [[Killing Curse|Avada Kedavra]] curse cast on him by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It burns when Voldemort is nearby or feeling particularly strong emotions, though this ceases after his death.

https://sims.fandom.com/wiki,Fanon:Anthony Nagel,"
Anthony is intended to look like his creator. He is a ''[[wikipedia:Filipino mestizo|mestizo]]'', or a person having both Asian and European features. When he designed his character, he asked for the help of his friends to ensure the accuracy of the author with the character. The height isn't though. His height was adjusted to fit the author's ""perfect"" specifications of 1.91 meters (6'3""). The character's physical appearance matches more of his mother than his father, except for his body shape and some minor details in the nose and the eyebrows. Like most people to date, he has black hair and brown eyes. He also has light skin that balances his Asian and European physical traits.

He is perceived to look ""teeny"" and youthful despite being a [[young adult]]. His voice was also slightly high-pitched at the beginning of the game when compared to other Sims. However, it did deepen as the story progresses. His voice as of late seems to be of lower pitch than most other Sims around. This makes his voice perfect for [[Singing]] and [[Charisma|speech practice]]. He also seem to be capable of narrating.

He is meticulous when it comes to picking his Everyday and Party clothes. This make him quite recognizable in social situations and in some occasions, it makes him Tense due to his Loner trait. For both incarnations of the character, he is always seen wearing glasses despite having clear eyesight. In ''The Sims 3'', he wore glasses for his Everyday and Formalwear. In ''The Sims 4'', he also wears glasses for his Party outfit and in his uniform for the current level of his Science career. It can be explained by the author's personality of making his real self ""confidential"" and the same rule applies for his supposed to be author avatar.

For both games, his favorite outside-the-house clothes are polo shirts, button-up shirts and t-shirts, the last being for his everyday attire. The only occasion when he wore sweaters and jackets were for ''[[The Sims 3: Seasons]]''. In ''The Sims 4'', he never wore any long-sleeved clothing at all aside from his formal attire where he naturally wears a suit. The longest cut he wears are elbow-length shirts. For his sleeping clothes, he prefers wearing skimpy attire such as tank tops and boxer shorts.

https://sims.fandom.com/wiki,Fanon:Anthony Nagel/TS3,"
Anthony's physical traits balances between the Asian traits of his mother and the European traits of his father. While he seems to acquire most of his facial features from his mother, he acquired his father's skin and nose. This is untrue for his character's traits from The Sims 4 where he also appears as a separate lead role and in which he slightly looks more Filipino than he looks like in this game where he looks more like a stereotypical Asian teenager. He has brown eyes and black hair, with light skin that makes him look a little more Chinese.

He wears varying sorts of eyeglasses for his [[Winterwear|Outerwear]], Everyday and Formal outfits. He has a second set of outfits for these three that are specifically made for the [[The Sims 3: Into the Future|future]]. When he first visited [[Oasis Landing]], he found his outfit and technology kind of awkward for this futuristic age. This is why he prepared himself for the next time he visits there so he can blend well with his descendants. These changes range from the outfits he uses to the furniture he has inside his house.

Just like in the other games, he wore different kinds of clothes. However, comparing his present incarnations in ''[[The Sims 3]]'' and ''[[The Sims 4]]'', he never wore sleeveless shirts outside the house. This time his clothes are also more diverse since he keeps on changing his clothes every 2 Sim days. No one recognizes that he uses the same type of clothes but with different designs thanks to maximizing the capabilities of the [[Create a Style]] feature, lessening the effort required to change a certain type of clothes.

Sometime during and after his second term in college, Anthony grew his hair as well as a small mustache. He also developed hair in his limbs as a result of late puberty development. This gave him a slightly more European look than his earlier appearance in the game. He still wore the large aviator-like glasses unless he is sleeping, exercising or swimming.

Sapphira generally inherited her father's Asian traits, although she inherited her mother's blue eyes which is the reason why she was named as such (being a form of the name Sapphire referring to the blue-colored gem). She has a small, high-pitched voice just like the other major female [[young adult|Young Adult]] characters in the Gourd Roger fanfictions. She has medium-length black hair that passes the shoulders, and she has a light Asian skin that is closer to Korean than Chinese.

Her Malay ethnic background makes her appearance quite indistinguishable from her partner Anthony to the point that the latter even spoke Filipino to her when they first met. Also, because of her parents' backgrounds, she also spoke with a British English-sounding accent of Simlish which started to disappear during her years in Isla Paradiso.

Her signature outfit consists of a collared shirt (usually long-sleeved), knee-length skirt, styled leggings and various forms of closed shoes so her leggings will not look awkward. She frequently uses the [[Create a Style]] to modify her clothing so she does not need to pick another clothes. She also wears glasses when wearing outfits outside of the house. She also had a geometric text tattoo on her right forearm that she got during her early Young Adult years. It was removed and replaced by an another one at the lower back in order not to be seen by college people, especially the older ones in the community.

Owing to his troubled past, Sebastian Castellanos has a constantly tired and worn look to him in stark contrast to his more well-groomed partner [https://theevilwithin.fandom.com/wiki/Joseph_Oda Joseph Oda]. He has a gaunt face marred with scars and a light five o'clock shadow that turned into a full beard by 2017. Due to stress and the timeskip between the games, Sebastian's hair had become even more wild and unkempt than it used to be, and he also has a more wrinkled face in the sequel.

She was one of the first of the Elemental Gods to be created along with [[Fan:Sequoiamon|Sequoiamon]], [[Fan:Cobaltmon|Cobaltmon]] and [[Fan:Brightmon|Brightmon]] before the exile of the Royal Family to the [[Dark Area]]. It's been said that Royalmon copied the data of [[AncientMegatheriummon]], without the latter's knowledge during [[Fan:Galenemon|Galenemon]] and [[Fan:Passiomon|Passiomon]]'s coronation to celebrate them reaching Ultimate Level. When the royal family was banished to the Dark Area, she served as the bodyguard and trained under [[Laylamon]], one of the [[Seven Great Demon Lords]]. She wears two necklaces one with the [[Crest of Reliability]] and the other with the symbol representing the [[Spirits of Ice]], which were given to her by Majestymon. Unlike the other female Elemental Gods, her body is modeled after both Galenemon and Himemon, the Ultimate forms of [[Fan:Sirenmon (Digimon Princess)|Sirenmon]] and [[Fan:Princessmon|Princessmon]]. Her complexion is very similar to that of [[Fan:Aquamon|Aquamon]] and her brother [[Fan:Cetusmon|Cetusmon]], often confusing the three of them as relatives. While she has a friendship with her fellow Elemental Gods, it's said she is the polar opposite of [[Fan:Aegaeonmon|Aegaeonmon]], the God of Wind. Influenced by Laylamon and the Royal Family, Tundramon often uses her ice powers to trap lost Digimon offering them a way to escape, but she often strikes them down or captures them to take them to the Dark Area. Her outfit bares a resemblance to {{wk|tsubasa|Sakura Li}} in ''Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle''.

*'''Cold Flare''' – Tundramon's body glows orange and creates a circular reddish-purple aura around herself. She then releases multiple reddish-purple beams of energy at the opponent. When it hits the opponent, it freezes them. 
*'''Powder Snow''' – Tundramon puts her hands in front of her body and a light blue light forms in front of them. A wind with sparkling blue powder is then released from the glow at the opponent, freezing them.
*'''Ice Throwing Stone''' – Tundramon jumps into the air and spins her body rapidly, releasing multiple glowing light blue balls of ice from her body at the opponent, or Tundramon raises her arms above her head and forms a light blue glowing ball of ice in between them. She then tosses the ball at the opponent.
*'''Super Ice Ray''' – She can fire one beam from either each eye or each index finger or even from her hands that causes everything it hits to freeze.

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki,Goku,"
[[File:Son-goku.jpg|thumb|left|Goku as a child, an adult, Super Saiyan, and Super Saiyan 3]]
Goku looks almost exactly like [[Bardock|his father]], possessing the same spiky black hairstyle, dark-colored eyes, and facial features. However, he has softer eyes, a kind demeanor, and a lighter-pale skin complexion from [[Gine|his mother]]. Goku's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his hair. He has three bangs hanging to the right of his forehead and two bangs hanging to the left. His hair also stands up in the front with four spikes and three bangs in the back (later in the anime, he has five spikes in the front and four in the back). Goku was born with the signature tail of the [[Universe 7]] Saiyans, which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrown multiple times in his early childhood, but in his late teens, Goku's tail was permanently removed by [[Kami]] in order to prevent his [[Great Ape]] transformation.

At age 12, Goku was rather short and appeared even younger than he was, being considered less than 10 years old (people were surprised when learning his actual age). His somewhat simple-minded personality also gave people the impression that he was as young as he looked. During the next few years, Goku did not go through any physical changes, other than his muscles becoming more pronounced. By age 15, he began showing noticeable increases in height. By age 18, he had a considerable growth spurt, growing taller than most of his friends and developing a well-built physique. He is also considered very handsome, as noted by various women including [[Bulma]] and [[Heles]]. His physical changes made him almost indistinguishable from before and was only recognized by his signature naïve personality and ""trademark"" hairstyle. By age 25, Goku had another growth spurt, and became similar in height to his taller human allies and much more muscular.

Due to his love of training, he is most commonly seen wearing a [[Gi]]. Originally, Goku wore an open blue gi secured with a white bow-tied obi over his waist, red wristbands, and dark blue kung fu shoes and also a tank top. After training under [[Master Roshi]], Goku wore the basic [[Turtle School Uniform]]; consisting of a closed red gi (later orange) secured by a black knot-tied obi over his waist, blue wristbands, and blue kung fu shoes, with Roshi's [[List of symbols|kanji]] on the back and front-left side of his shirt. After training with Kami and [[Mr. Popo]], Goku wore a black short-sleeved undershirt (later dark blue) with this gi and replaced his shoes with dark blue boots with a yellow border and red laces. After training under [[King Kai]], Goku wore King Kai's kanji on the back of his gi shirt. During the [[Battle on Planet Namek]], Goku wore his own kanji on both sides of his gi shirt. During the [[Android conflict]] and [[Majin Buu conflict]], Goku wore a more plain version of this gi that lacked any kanji and featured a blue sash-style obi over his waist, as well as the same dark blue undershirt, same wristbands and the same boots from his previous gi, but with a red border and yellow/tan laces. He later retains this outfit throughout most of ''[[Dragon Ball Super (anime)|Dragon Ball Super]]'' as he regains his own kanji on both sides of his gi shirt.

During his early training under [[Whis]], Goku wore an orange traditional and loose gi, with Whis' kanji on the front-left of his shirt, that was secured together with a blue obi tied in a knot at the left of his waist. He also wore blue wristbands that cover nearly his entire forearms and blue boots that clasp together on the front of his shins.

In ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]'', Goku returns to wearing a knot-style obi with his regular uniform and ""Go"" kanji (essentially regaining his [[Frieza Saga]] appearance). In addition, to compensate for the wintery climate he is on, he also wears a long blue snow jacket with a high turtleneck, white stripes down his shoulders and arms and bold purple letters of ""SAB"" over the front-left side of it. It also has black gloves. In the [[Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga]], Goku is given the emblem of the [[Galactic Patrol]] in place of his own on the front of his uniform and also switches back to wearing a sash-style obi. In the [[Granolah the Survivor Saga]], Goku regains Whis' kanji on his standard gi when the angel trains him in honing [[Autonomous Ultra Instinct (ability)|Ultra Instinct]].

Gotenks greatly resembles [[Vegeta]] in terms of his hairstyle, and facial expressions. His hair style is a mixture of the hair of both Trunks and Goten, with the front and back of his hair being black like those of Goten's, and the sides being the purple/white color that Trunks' hair is. Gotenks also has a widow's peak. Like the genetic composition of Goten and Trunks, Gotenks is a [[Saiyan#Hybrid|Saiyan/Human hybrid]] and can thus turn Super Saiyan; the style of his hair is similar overall to Goten's while in Super Saiyan form. His body is also very toned and muscular, especially for someone his age.

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki,General Blue,"
General Blue is a tall, blond-haired, blue eyed man with a handsome appearance. He also has a muscular build, even without his powering up. He usually wears a uniform composed of a brown double-breasted suit and red tie (black in the manga and ''The Path to Power''), a brown double-layered officer's cap with the Red Ribbon Army logo prominently displayed (with the 1990s remake of ''Dr. Slump'' giving the bottom layer a blue color), a Red Ribbon Army logo patch on one of his shoulders (right shoulder in the anime, left in the manga) a black belt (brown in the manga) with a side-strap on the right shoulder as well as a gold (Silver in ''Path to Power'' and the 1990s remake of ''Dr. Slump''.) circular belt buckle depicting an eagle alongside a smaller buckle colored the same (gold in the anime, silver in the manga and ''Path to Power'', with the only exception being the 1990s remake of ''Dr. Slump'', where the smaller buckle was colored gold instead of silver), blue horse-riding trousers, and black jackboots. He also possesses a blue armband on his left arm with his name on it. Unlike the other members of the Red Ribbon Army, General Blue does not wear a red bandana around the arm or neck. He also has slight eyelashes near the edges of his eyes, a subtle hint at his effeminate, homosexual nature.

Out of all the redesigns in the ''Path to Power'', Blue's redesign resembles his anime counterpart the most. The only significant differences are that he was slightly slimmer than in the anime and manga, and his hairstyle is slightly longer. Coincidentally, the redesign also resembled [[Barry Kahn]].

In ''Mystical Adventure'', he wears a completely different uniform, owing to him being a member of the Mifan Army. The uniform in question resembles a cross between a samurai outfit and a Roman Centurion.

Frieza possesses an entire range of [[transformation]]s, each one being quite different than the others. It is implied by [[Vegeta]] and Frieza himself in the series that Frieza's fourth, most powerful form is actually his original form, with the other three being forms that suppress and conserve his enormous power. Frieza later confirms this while fighting the main protagonist, [[Goku]]. His forms seem to revolve around both western and Japanese concepts of [[demon]]s.

In his first form, Frieza usually wears a standard armor of his army, consisting of a purple body suit with yellow shoulder guards. He also appears to wear black shorts. He also occasionally wears a red scouter. When in his true natural form and also his golden form, Frieza wears his race's ultimate Bio Suit, the Z Fighting Suit. When in his Mecha form, his body is equipped with a permanent Cosmic Suit. In the Universe Survival Saga, he has a halo on his head due to being dead, although this is removed after the tournament due to Whis restoring his life for ""good behavior.""

[[File:Vegeta_DBGT_Ep_59_001.png|thumb|left|Vegeta's Super Saiyan 4 form]]
In this form, the Saiyan's hair color differs, the same goes for the [[tail]] and the body is covered in red fur. A Saiyan in this form also possesses a shadow trim around their eyes and over the eyelids that varies in color, such as crimson. The hair is lengthened while becoming wilder, reaching down to the middle of their back, while two long pointed bangs of hair appear on both sides of the neck. It also makes the individual considerably larger in height and muscularity, as shown by Vegeta when his time limit ended and he reverted to his considerably smaller size.

The [[aura]] in this form loses the arcs of electricity, once again shaped like a regular Super Saiyan's smooth aura, (although in various video games, the aura was depicted as reddish with a small yellowish glow and sparks of bio-electricity). Most games depict the aura as the standard gold.

In the case of the [[Fusion Dance]] warrior [[Gogeta]], the coloration of the aforementioned features seemingly switches, as Gogeta's hair became a bright shade of red whereas his fur became a dark shade of brown and the trim around his eyes were black instead of red. His aura also has yellow sparkles to it.

For Broly, his Super Saiyan 4 form is much like that of Goku's, though because he is using Legendary Super Saiyan 4, he retains the massively oversized muscles and lack of pupils his standard Legendary form possessed.

The form also apparently has a seemingly magical ability to restore the wearer's bottom clothing (in a manner reminiscent of [[Magic Materialization]] or clothing produced by the [[Metamoran]] [[Fusion Dance]]) even if it had been destroyed as a result of transforming into a [[Great Ape]] and/or [[Golden Great Ape]] beforehand to achieve Super Saiyan 4. This happens to both Goku and Vegeta (due to the Saiyan Prince wearing Earthling attire in ''GT'').  However upper body clothing that can adjust to the size of a Great Ape such as Gogeta's [[Metamoran]] vest (as the clothing is byproduct of the Fusion Dance) or Broly's necklace (which is seemingly designed to change size like Saiyan Battle Armor) will remain upon achieving Super Saiyan 4. However as shown by [[Bardock]], [[Xeno Bardock]], and [[Xeno Vegeta]] the upper body portions of their Saiyan Battle Armor are ironically removed while in their respective Super Saiyan 4 forms.

Goten's appearance as a child is a spitting image of Goku's childhood look, including messy, unkempt hair, same eye color, lighter-pale complexion and a playful face. He also wears an orange [[gi]] similar to Goku's, minus the ''kame'' symbol, along with a dark blue long-sleeved undershirt and black training shoes with dark blue shin guards in the Majin Buu Arc. Goten is known for looking almost identical to his father as a child, to the point when Goku first meets Goten he proclaims ""I think there is a little ''me'' hiding behind your leg Chi-Chi!"" This resemblance to his father is pointed out numerous times by other characters throughout the series, as well as in a few video games. His appearance drastically changes as he grows older, towards the end of ''Dragon Ball Z''. Goten's hair grew, so that he would not be mistaken for Goku and is seen with a shaggier hairstyle similar to Yamcha and also wears an orange gi similar to what Pan wears at the World Martial Arts Tournament.

In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Goten wears his gi without the blue undershirt as he did in the Majin Buu Saga. He also wears blue armbands, which he previously didn't and his hairstyle still resembles that of his father. When not fighting, he wears a blue sleeveless changshan with a green trim and a lavender long sleeve shirt underneath with white folded sleeves and a long red sash tied around his waist which it was concealed beneath his changshan, lavender Chinese pants with white folded sleeves and black Kung-Fu shoes.

For the movie ''Super Hero,'' as it takes place a year before the end of Z, he's older. He is taller and wears a long green, buttoned shirt, and has hair similar to his older brother Gohan, in the Cell Saga. He also wears a purple undershirt, alongside black pants and black shoes. 

In ''Dragon Ball GT'', his hairstyle becomes spiky, straight and tilted. He begins to look like his brother Gohan as in contrast to Goku. In the Black Star Dragon Ball Saga, Goten wears a green long-sleeved shirt with a yellow t-shirt underneath and wears purple chino pants and light beige golden boots just like the ones Trunks wore. Later in the Baby saga, his outfit has been changed to a new color. his long-sleeved shirt is white with a purple t-shirt underneath and his chino pants are lavender.

Mr. Satan is a tall man of a rather muscular and hairy physique and tends to adopt an imposing appearance when seen in public. His black curly Afro, mustache, and well-trimmed sideburns are among his most recognizable traits, as well as his cleft chin. Mr. Satan typically is seen in his martial arts uniform or in fitted suits, but has been known to wear more luxurious clothing when resting or making public appearances. His gi is often accented with either a red or white cape depending on which gi he dons, and his notably hairy chest and arms are usually displayed openly.

In the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'' and throughout ''Dragon Ball GT'', his black curly afro is now in half as the center of his head is naturally bald and a few wrinkles due to his age. In his later years, his mustache now connects to his sideburns.

In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Mr. Satan's muscular physique has visibly weakened as a result of indulging in his fame over keeping up with his training, though he otherwise remains the same as his appearance in ''Dragon Ball Z''.

Tien Shinhan is a tall and very muscular bald-headed man. His by far most prominent feature is his third eye, which he has inherited from his alien ancestors (although some sources claim the third eye was achieved via intense meditation).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II]]'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye is indeed real, as he has proved at several occasions that he can both move it around and close it, and even shoot ki laser beams out of it. Allegedly, Tien is not naturally bald, as it is stated by his former mentor, [[Master Shen]], that he shaves his head much like [[Krillin]] does, though unlike Krillin he has never been seen unshaven. Another noteworthy trait of his, is the large scar on the right side of his chest, starting at his collar bone and running all the way down to his abdomen; Tien received this scar at the [[23rd World Martial Arts Tournament]] during his fight against his former mentor, [[Mercenary Tao]], who caught him off guard with his illegal [[Hidden Blade]] attack, scarring him for life.

Throughout the series he was worn a large number of outfits, however, out of all of his many outfits, the most iconic one most likely has to be the [[Gi]] he wore during the [[Androids Saga]]; which consists of a green baggy one shoulder tank top, a pair of baggy green pants, red-and-green wristbands, black boots with yellow covers and a red sash. Tien's non-combat outfit typically consists of a Hanfu-style robe with loose pants and boots, in contrast to the Manchu-style clothing that most Chinese characters in the series wears.

Tien wears a primarily green, black and brown-red formal outfit in ''Battle of Gods'' and the manga version of the Universe 6 and Universe Survival Sagas. In ''Resurrection ‘F’'' and the anime version of the Universe 6 and Universe Survival Sagas he wears a primarily black, pale yellow and brown-red version of this outfit.

Gohan resembles Yamcha in hairstyle, but inherits his father's facial features and black eyes. At the same time, he has his mother's light peach complexion rather than his father's light tan. Also taking after his father, Gohan inherited a Saiyan [[tail]], which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrew a few times during his childhood until removed permanently by [[Vegeta]] in their first battle.

When first introduced as a young child, he had short and spiky but relatively well-kept hair. He wore a white sleeveless shirt and green pants with black boots with white lacing, this outfit was covered in a Hanfu-style top that was yellow with green sleeves and on the front his family name, 'Son', written in kanji within a large white circle with black lining. He also wore a red cap with the Four-Star Dragon Ball attached to the top. He later removes the Hanfu-style top to show his outfit when he is ready to train with Piccolo.

While training with [[Piccolo]], after losing his previous outfit from transforming into a Great Ape, he wears an outfit similar to Goku's original, consisting of an orange gi and black belt with a black undershirt, blue wristbands, and black boots with yellow lasing. In the Anime, his uniform is the same as Piccolo's consisting of a purple gi with a red sash and armbands, bronze grass shoes, and a white collar around his neck. At the same time, he wore with the 'Ma' symbol (魔) and his hair grew out more into a mullet-style that reached his shoulders. By the fight against the Saiyans, Gohan grows noticeably more muscular for a child and dons a similar attire to the Namekian warriors. He also sported a white bandana. Gohan's hair has been cut short and has three thick fringes on his head. Before going to Namek with Krillin and Bulma, Gohan is initially seen wearing an outfit worn in private elementary school and later his Namekian outfit. During his battle against Frieza, Vegeta gave Gohan a [[Battle Armor]], which consisted of a blue jumpsuit with white gloves and boots, and a white torso protection with yellow shoulder pads.

During the Androids Saga, his hair grew even longer, reaching his thighs, and his Namekian outfit was modified to include black kung-fu shoes and white shins. While training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, he wore a similar Battle Armor from Planet Namek, which lacked shoulder pads. After leaving the Time Chamber, he grows noticeably taller (roughly Krillin's height), and also quite muscularly developed for his age. He reverts to Piccolo's clothing for the [[Cell Game]]s, with the addition of Piccolo's white cape and weighted shoulder pads. During this time his hair is spiky much like Goku's.

As a young adult, he becomes similar in height to his father. His hair is much shorter and stands on end in a spiky formation, with a single bang hanging over the right side of his forehead. Having slacked off in training, he looks noticeably skinnier and leaner in frame, though still respectfully muscular. Also similar to his father, Gohan is noted as being very attractive by many females such as [[Erasa]] and [[Angela]]. He alternates between a school uniform, his Great Saiyaman costume, and a blue gi similar to the Piccolo clothing. While wearing his blue gi, his obi, wrist bands and shin guards are red but in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly - Second Coming]]'', the shin guards are reverted to white. During the Buu Saga, he wears Kai clothing given to him by [[Kibito]]. In his fight against Super Buu and reuniting with his father and Vegeta after they defeated Kid Buu, Gohan wears an outfit identical to his father. At the party for the celebration of the defeat of Kid Buu, he wears a blue suit as part of his formal clothing.

As an adult in the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'', Gohan's hair would be similar to how it was in the Buu Arc minus the bang which resembles Yamcha's hairstyle from the Androids Saga.

Raditz's appearance consists of extremely long, spiky black hair with a prominent widow's peak, brown and black colored [[Battle Armor]] in the same style as the rest of Frieza's soldiers, with boots, armored gloves, and a [[scouter]] that is blue on the title page of [[Kakarrot|Chapter 196]], and green in the anime and full color manga. Additionally, he wears two accessory bands that are white in the manga and red in the anime: one is tightened around his left arm, and the other on his left leg. Raditz also inherits Bardock's eyes and complexion.

Raditz may be the only Saiyan whose hair actually grows longer as he grows up, which carries over into his Super Saiyan 3 form.

Nappa is a tall and muscular man. Though [[Saiyan#Aging, lifespan, and growth|his Saiyan genes]] give him the appearance of someone in their mid-30s, Nappa is approximately 50 years old when he is first shown in the series. At this time, he looks identical all the way to the time of his death; though his structure in his younger years shows him to be a bit slimmer. His thin mustache tends to change with each part in his life; as at middle age of 30's his mustache smaller in comparison than it is now; by the range of the Saiyan Saga, Nappa's mustache is slightly larger, longer, splits into two sections (noting he tends to shaves his facial hair on occasion) and then it grows back fully during the year one radius to Earth. In ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Nappa's skin tone is given a noticeable reddish-pink tan. His mustache has grown slightly thicker and noticeably longer. It is also split into two sections again, but noticeably has peach fuzz in the middle noting he shaved it sometime while he was dead and it is growing back. He has hair in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku]]'' (although it seems to be a small patch, lacking sideburns of any kind). Like most Saiyans, Nappa wears a [[scouter]].

He has his father's eye shape, facial features and tanned skin and his hair turns blond and eyes turn (pupil-less) green when he becomes a [[Super Saiyan]]. Several characters, such as Goku, Krillin and Bulma, remark how much Trunks resembles Vegeta. For the majority of the Buu Saga, Present Trunks wears a dark green [[gi]], an orange belt, orange wristbands and the same golden boots that Future Trunks wears, he also wears this in the movie, Bio-Broly. In the events of Broly - Second Coming, Trunks wears a light green long sleeve hoodie with a black short sleeve undershirt with a red collar, indigo blue denim shorts and his golden boots from his primary outfit. He later wears [[Maloja]]'s necklace. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', Trunks wears overalls and a blue undershirt with maroon wristbands. At the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'', Trunks now wears a black long-sleeved shirt, a golden vest, dark gray pants and the same golden boots that he wore as a child. Later, he wears a black sleeveless muscle shirt with a CAPSULE logo at the center of his shirt, gray pants and his boots from his childhood.

In ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', Trunks wears a yellow jacket with a white undershirt, jeans, yellow boots, and maroon wristbands. During Bulma's birthday party, he wears a Hawaiian shirt with shorts and sunglasses.

In &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, since the movie takes place a year before the end of DBZ, Trunks is now older.

In ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Trunks wears a black long-sleeved shirt with a blue bandana, brown leather gloves, a light tan blazer, white baggy short slacks, and now he wear brown boots. During the events of Baby Saga, where Baby possessed him until the events of the Shadow Dragon Saga, he is not seen wearing his light tan blazer. His hair is now purple instead of lavender.

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki,Chiaotzu,"
Chiaotzu is an Earthling who possesses a few different traits than most, such as plain white skin and red cheeks. Like [[Krillin]], Chiaotzu does not have a visible nose and is quite short in height. Chiaotzu has a single, wiry hair on his head, only seen after he removes his hat. His outfit throughout the majority of the series consists of the entire Crane School uniform. By the second half of the [[Vegeta Saga]], however, he ditches the robe for a white tank top. In the [[Majin Buu Saga]], like Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu wears a blue Hanfu (Han Chinese-style) robe with a white cloak and pants, and though he wears a Mongolian-style hat in the manga, he keeps the Crane School cap in the anime. He also does not appear to age.

Chiaotzu's design is based on [[Jiang Shi]] (Chinese vampires). The similarities are displayed in both his appearance and also when Chiaotzu performs some of his attacks. Jiang Shi is described as having white skin, red cheeks and wearing an outfit from the {{w|Qing Dynasty}}. These [[ghost]]s cannot walk (only hop), and they always keep their arms stretched out in front of them. These qualities are all referenced in Chiaotzu to some extent: when first encountered, Chiaotzu [[Flight|flies]] more often than walks, and his attacks are executed by stretching his arms. Chiaotzu's outfit also resembles a Qing one. At the time Chiaotzu debuted, there was a {{w|Jiangshi fiction|Jiang Shi movie}} craze throughout East Asia, specifically Hong Kong's ''{{w|Mr. Vampire}}'' and Taiwan's ''Hello Dracula'' movie series.

Another possibility is that Chiaotzu was inspired by {{w|Nezha (deity)|Nezha}} from ''[[Journey to the West]]'', the novel [[Akira Toriyama]] used as a prototype for his own work when he began creating the ''Dragon Ball'' manga series. Nezha is usually depicted as a baby with a totally white body, much like Chiaotzu. Nezha is an opponent of Sun Wukong (who inspired [[Goku]]) and one of his allies is Erlang Shen, a god depicted with three eyes. This makes Chiaotzu and Tien a fitting pair, being similar in appearance to Nezha and Erlang respectively.

[[File:Piccolo(manga).png|thumb|left|Piccolo with his manga colors (''WJ'' #12, 1993)]]
Piccolo is a very tall and muscular Namekian. While greatly resembling his father/incarnation, he is noticeably shorter and somewhat thinner. He also has a more solid facial structure with less pronounced cheekbones, a rounder chin, and a straight nose. Piccolo only has four fingers with black nails in the [[Dragon Ball (manga)|''Dragon Ball'' manga]], but five fingers with white nails in the anime series and the [[Dragon Ball Super (manga)|''Dragon Ball Super'' manga]]. He has several patches on his arms which are pink in the anime and yellow in the manga (and in the film ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero]]'').

Piccolo Jr.'s outfit when he was a kid is very similar to the one King Piccolo is first seen wearing, with the same color scheme shown on the ''[[Kanzenban]]'' manga covers. From the time he is a young adult onward, Piccolo wears a dark purplish-blue gi, pointy orange shoes and sky blue obi (red in the manga). When not fighting seriously, Piccolo also wears a white turban with a dark purplish-blue top and a white cape along with it.

Like Goku, Piccolo generally wears and trains with [[Weighted clothing]]. The cape itself is not weighted, but there is weighted padding underneath; this is seen twice in the series: when his cape is damaged while fighting Frieza in his second form, and when it is damaged by [[Slug's Demon Clan|Lord Slug's henchmen]]. As the series went on, Piccolo Jr.'s outfit became more his own and by the time he faced the Androids. The outfit's neckline becomes more low-cut like Goku's outfit, minus Goku's own undershirt. In the manga, many of the movies, and certain [[video games]] (''[[Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2|Supersonic Warriors 2]]'' and ''[[Super Dragon Ball Z]]''), Piccolo wears a red obi rather than a sky blue one.

Even though Piccolo Jr. discards his old symbol, he uses it once in the series when he made his pupil Gohan a uniform after his previous outfit was torn in a [[Great Ape]] [[transformation]]. In a [[filler]] episode in the anime, when both of them are forced by Goku's wife [[Chi-Chi]] to go to driving school, Piccolo wears an old outfit of Goku's, which he despised wearing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' episode 125, ""[[Goku's Ordeal]]""&lt;/ref&gt;

When King Piccolo is introduced in chapter 135, ""[[The Death of Kuririn]]"", he is designed to appear as a strange-looking divine creature, like a goblin, who has pointy ears and fangs. The audience is later introduced to Kami, King Piccolo's good counterpart, and the two share an almost identical resemblance; with Kami's outfit even being a palette swap of King Piccolo's robe outfit. Kami never removes his robe for combat, but in a flashbacks, he is shown wearing the same dark [[gi]] as King Piccolo, but with his own kanji on under it. Later in the series, when other normal [[Namekian]]s are introduced, it is revealed that this is the Namekians' typical appearance. At over eight feet tall, King Piccolo is by far one of the tallest and largest of the villains in the original [[Dragon Ball (anime)|''Dragon Ball'' series]], towering over all his opponents, including [[Master Mutaito]], [[Master Roshi]], [[Tien Shinhan]], and [[Goku]]. King Piccolo's size and height are never explored upon, as no other Namekian (including Kami) is shown in their normal state to be King Piccolo's size and height, being that most are shown to be the size of normal humans, even [[Nail]], their last remaining [[Warrior-type Namekian|warrior]], being at the height of Piccolo's reincarnation who was slightly shorter. Though, it is never determined if he is actually taller than Kami in his advanced age. One explanation to this could be His demon origins are much larger and less sleek than the Namekians, as shown from [[Grand Elder Guru]] and his humongous size Namekians can probably control their size at will.

[[File:King_Piccolo_Gurus_Gift.png|thumb|King Piccolo sometime early in his first conquest]]
When he first fully appears, King Piccolo is very aged and wears a black robe outfit with his own [[List of symbols|kanji]], a red cape, along with brown light-weight footwear. His main outfit, without the robe and cape, is an indigo Asian [[martial arts]] uniform, with a light purple obi. King Piccolo's outfit is later revealed in the [[Namek Saga]] as being of Namekian Clothing with Demon Symbols, rather than actually having much to do with martial arts, though his kanji is something he added when he came into being which was meant to be the opposite to Kami's kanji.

After King Piccolo removes the robe for better performance, he nearly kills Goku with [[Makosen|simple blasts]] and temporarily stops his heart, which may imply that, like his son [[Piccolo|Piccolo Junior]]'s cape, his robe is weighted.

He is shirtless while wearing white pants with a red sash draped around his waist and secured by a yellow belt with a blue gem-center. He also wears similar yellow boots with a blue gem at the top the front. It is implied that the outfit was made of a similar material to the [[Battle Armor]], regardless of what size-increasing transformation he used, his clothing always remained intact and grew in size with him.

To better control Broly and his power as his mental-instability continued to grow, [[Paragus]] placed [[Broly's Crown|a crown]] on Broly's forehead, along with wristbands and a necklace with a flat plate over the chest, each of which are golden with a blue gem. Broly also wore golden bands over his biceps. After breaking free from Paragas' control, Broly's crown, neckband and armbands were destroyed. After Broly's defeat against Goku, he obtained scorch marks across his chest.

Interestingly, he possesses neither a nose nor teeth, though in early episodes of ''Dragon Ball'' he is shown to possess a single tooth. He has a modest stature and appears to be a grade shorter than the average [[Earthling]]. He nearly always wears a smile, but does express a range of emotions depending on the circumstances. His polite, formal style complements his calm demeanor and upright posture. Mr. Popo's appearance does not change over the span of years comprising ''Dragon Ball'', ''Dragon Ball Z'', ''Dragon Ball Super'' and ''Dragon Ball GT''. This agelessness results from his [[Other World|Otherworldly]] origins.

Mr. Popo's outfit likewise never changes during the course of the series. He is always seen wearing a white turban adorned with an aqua-colored jewel resting on his forehead.

Videl is a beautiful fair-skinned (pale-skinned color in the anime series) young child and young woman of very slim figure build and below average height with straight black hair that has side bangs with five loose short strands over her forehead, light-blue eyes and a slender frame yet athletic physique. Over the course of the series, Videl has had five different hairstyles:
*She originally had low pigtails that stop at her chest, while learning to fly from [[Gohan]].
*At the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'', her hair is flat and pixie cut short with cropped spiky style bangs and in the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament, her hair in the sides reaching down to her style of a bob-length cut reaching her cheeks and has bangs to frame her face.
*In ''Dragon Ball Super'', her hair reached down to her shoulders with a flat bang front over her forehead and red headband. 
*In ''Dragon Ball GT'', her hair grows long where it reaches her lower back and it is done in a low braided ponytail with a few strands hanging over her forehead and ears.

In her first appearances, Videl usually wears a long white shirt that went past her waist with tight black spandex compression shorts that reach her upper thighs, black fingerless gloves, purple socks, green shoes, and gold hair clips for her pigtails. In ""[[Gohan's First Date]]"", she wears a white T-shirt with purple sleeves, light blue short jeans, black fingerless gloves, purple socks, and green shoes. After she learned how to fly, she wears a white sleeveless loose shirt, a pink T-shirt, black spandex short shorts, black fingerless gloves, purple socks, and yellow boots. In the beginning in both ""[[Gather for the Tournament]]"" episode and ''Broly - Second Coming'', she retains this outfit only her black spandex short shorts are replaced with a black capris pants and white boots with pink tips.

[[File:Screenshot 2018-12-14-20-35-12.png|thumb|left|Videl wearing a Gi while training at her father's dojo before the tournament after completing her flight training in ""Gathering for the Tournament""]]
However in the anime she briefly wears a white [[Gi]] with a black undershirt, black pants, black sash, dark blue socks and blue boots. After Videl was healed with a Senzu Bean—and for the majority of the Buu Saga—she wears white pants, a blue and orange ""FIGHT"" T-shirt with an orange long-sleeved shirt underneath (white in the original manga), orange shoes and retains her short hair.

During ''Broly - Second Coming'', she wears a bright maroon dress with a green cloth wrapping around the waist, with a large hat and grey tights.

In ''Fusion Reborn'', she wears clothes similar to her Buu Saga outfit only with alternate colors.

In ''Wrath of the Dragon'', she wears a yellow long-sleeved shirt and a white mini skirt that reached her upper thighs. The final attire she ever wore as a teen, before the 28th World Tournament, was a blue dress with a pink vest, blue thigh-high stockings, and pink loafers. She also wore this during the dance party that Bulma hosted to celebrate Majin Buu's defeat. At the end of the series, she wears a red dress and a red mini skirt with her hair grown back.

Between the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'' to ''Dragon Ball GT'', Videl's hair grows back to its length, reaching her hips and is done up in a long braid.

In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Videl is first seen with her current chin-length hair and she has had it ever since. She originally sported a pink sweater-dress that reached her upper thighs, with a red stripe around the chest area, along with black tights and bright pink shoes with darker pink soles. For Bulma's party throughout the [[God of Destruction Beerus Saga]], she changed her style to a red dress with a devil face mark on the chest, black leggings, and white boots. There is one scene in an episode of ''Dragon Ball Super'' where Videl isn't wearing her leggings. This is most likely because of an animation mistake. For the [[Golden Frieza Saga]], she sports a plain red dress with her normal current hairstyle, black tights and white high heel shoes. Her design changed drastically from a teenage tomboy style to a typical house-wife style, indicating how much Videl has mellowed out to becoming a more domestic character.

In the Black Star Dragon Ball Saga, Videl wears an outfit similar to Android 18's first outfit; a light teal denim jacket and skirt with a yellow short sleeve undershirt, dark gray leggings with white folded sleeves at the edge, brown belt and her yellow boots from her second outfit. Later in the Baby saga, her outfit has been changed to a new color. both denim jacket and skirt are light blue with a pink short sleeve undershirt from her main.

Arale has the appearance of a little girl with purple hair and wears glasses. Over the years of the series run, Toriyama tended to end up drawing Arale shorter and making her look a lot younger than her appearance at the beginning of the series.

As a baby and little girl, she resembles her father: she has his eye shape and lack of nose. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Marron's appearance remains largely the same but her hairstyle was changed from pigtails to a mushroom-style haircut. She also wears earrings. Despite being nine in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', Marron has not grown. Likely due to her father's genetics, Marron's growth was delayed.

In ''GT'', Marron now resembles her mother at age 19; her eyes now noticeably blue and a fair skin complexion. Marron is between her parents in height; she's taller than Krillin, but just a bit shorter than 18. Her hair goes down to her shoulders and is kept in two pigtails once again with three loose short strands are hanging on her forehead. She's now wearing the long-sleeved polo undershirt, pink dress and hat, white socks and brown shoes. Additionally, her nose has grown to the point it is visible, while as a child she appeared to be noseless like her father.

Paragus is one of the few Saiyans shown to wear [[Battle Armor]] different to that of Frieza's employ; Paragus's armor vaguely resembles that of Goku's [[Yardrat]] outfit. The armor he wears frequently changes colors throughout various flashbacks. Also, in one case, it looks like he was not wearing any armor. He also wears a white collared cape that touches the ground and covers the right half of his body. Because of Broly's actions during his childhood, Paragus' left eye was injured and has a scar running from his left eyebrow to his cheek at the time of ''Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan''.

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki,Krillin,"
[[File:KrillinDragonBallDebut.png|thumb|left|Krillin in ''Dragon Ball'']]
Krillin does not have a visible nose, however, in a fourth wall breaking manner he seems to be able to smell until someone mentions it (like Goku during the 21st [[World Martial Arts Tournament]]): he smells the diamond Bulma took from the Pirate Cave, and he smells the enticing trap meal in the [[Mirror spaceship]]. In the ''[[Dragon Ball: Adventure Special]]'' magazine, when asked why Krillin does not have a nose, Akira Toriyama responded ""Krillin has a physical idiosyncrasy that allows him to breathe through his skin."" Earlier on in the series, and throughout the entire manga, Krillin had white eyes that were often squinty looking, giving off a bored expression. However, later on, his eyes are more open, and the color of them seem to have disappeared completely, making the inside of his eyes the same color as his skin.
Krillin is not naturally bald. Due to his original monastic training, he merely shaves his head. During his training with Goku under Master Roshi, Krillin comments that ""All who aspire to master the martial arts shave their heads in order to unfetter their ''ki''"" and seemed surprised to find out Master Roshi was naturally bald. He also mentions that he waxes his head to keep himself bald. After settling down with his new family, his hair grows out, although his original smooth crowned look is the most familiar to fans. The six dots on his forehead are scars from {{w|moxibustion}} burns,&lt;ref&gt;鳥山明「とりやまさんのDRAGON BALLなんでもかんでもコーナー」『DRAGON BALL　第6巻』集英社〈ジャンプコミックス〉、1987年3月15日、ISBN 4-08-851836-5、p.190-191。&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the pattern that appear on the forehead of a Shaolin monk.

His first appearance of Dragon Ball and in Fortuneteller Baba saga, he wears a yellow short sleeved Chinese garb with the sleeves are folded to make it sleeveless adorned with purple straps in each sides, orange Chinese pants with a purple belt on his waist, white shins and an ochre Chinese toe shoes. During the 21st and 23rd Martial Arts Tournament, Krillin wears a red turtle gi like Goku's and became his signature outfit in ''Dragon Ball Z'' through both Vegeta Saga and in the Namek Saga.

In the Androids Saga and throughout the Cell Saga, Krillin wears an outfit identical to Goku's first outfit in both Vegeta Saga and throughout the Frieza Saga as the tie of his boots are light blue.

In the Buu Saga, Krillin has his black hair grow out and wears various casual outfits. When he was married with Android 18, he wears an orange short sleeved loose button shirt, white shorts and red sandals. In the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, he first appears wearing an orange vest with a white short sleeve undershirt, green denim shorts with a brown belt on his waist, white socks and brown shoes. In the movie, ''Bio-Broly'', his vest appears to be black. During the tournament and onwards, he wears a red short sleeve shirt, khaki jogging pants with a white tie at the center and black sneakers. In Dragon Ball Super, when Krillin still had black hair, it is noticeably shorter than how it is in the Buu Saga. Krillin retained his shaved head in ''Shin Budokai'' despite it taking place after the Majin Buu Saga, with it being implied in the beginning that such had been the result of 18 and Marron playing with his head while he was asleep.

During ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' and the earlier episodes of ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', Krillin wears his black hair in a short, fairly spikey style and dons a green ''changshan'' (Chinese men's coat) with a Turtle School crest on the left breast as a mark of respect for Master Roshi, in addition to dark blue-gray pants and charcoal-gray kung fu shoes. Strangely, in the manga, his head remains shaven.

[[File:Krillin scan.png|thumb|left|Krillin in ''Resurrection ‘F’'']]
By the time of ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’]]'', Krillin has taken up the job of a [[police]] officer, he wears a uniform with a yellow polo shirt and purple formal shorts, a badge, and a helmet. When getting prepared to battle Frieza, Krillin asks Android 18 to shave his head for ""old times sake"". When he is off-duty, Krillin wears a red short sleeved shirt with a sign ""Taco"" at the center, jeans and blue sneakers. In preparation for the Tournament of Power, Krillin once again wears his orange turtle school gi, minus the weighted clothing he previously wore during the Android Saga through the Cell Games Saga, although his gi has become visibly faded with time, leaving it a more pale orange compared to Goku and Gohan's versions of the outfit.

In the end of ''Dragon Ball Z'', Krillin wears a business attire like his wife, Android 18 and has a fedora hat on his head.

In the events of ''Dragon Ball GT'', Krillin's hair is now gray and gains a mustache. He retains wearing the business attire at the end of ''Dragon Ball Z''; a teal formal vest with a white long sleeved button shirt with the sleeves are folded into cuffs and a light purple long neck tie on the collar, brown pants and black shoes.

Bojack is depicted as having a muscular build and resembles something of a gypsy-[[pirate]]. His skin is colored teal, his long hair is orange and he has a long scar scaling his face. Bojack has a maximum-power [[transformation]] which renders his skin chartreuse, his hair red and his muscle mass increased over the top. His outfit is also shredded by the transformation.

In the [[Universe Creation Saga]], Bojack's appearance is significantly different. His hair appears spikier than before (similar in style to a [[Super Saiyan 3]]), and instead of his black band hat, he wears a thick headband. In addition, he wears a dark blue long coat and brown pants, all with golden buckles. He has an x-shaped scar on his torso as well as an additional horizontal scar across his nose.

His physical appearance is very similar to his sons', looking nearly identical to Frieza in his second form. King Cold possess horns that have lines on them.

At the time when his role as emperor of the Cold Force came to an end King Cold's skin was purple, the gem on his head was purple, the armor on his wrists was white and he wore a red cape, he also wore black battle armor with yellow sections.

The armor is blue in ''Dragon Ball Z'', but brown in ''Dragon Ball GT''. The ""dome"" on his head is colored dark blue (though it sometimes appears dark teal in the anime).

In ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]'', her hair has grown and is in two small ponytails being held by red hairpieces. She wears a pink footie.

She also wears a red hairpiece, gold choker, and gold hoop earrings. Her outward appearance in ''GT'' makes her seem older, and she is even hit on by two grown men in ""[[The Attack on Vegeta]]"".

This agelessness seems to hold somewhat true for her husband as well.

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki,Future Warrior,"
As a custom character, the Future Warrior's appearance is entirely dictated by the player, whose race can be [[Majins]], [[Saiyans]], [[Earthlings]], [[Namekians]] and [[Frieza's Race]], with the first three having male and female versions. The skin and hair color can be customized to make the player character look like some other races such as the [[Hera Clan]]. This is strictly cosmetic. Initially the Future Warrior is created with a simple uniform but the player can buy a wide variety of clothing and accessories historically worn by characters from ''Dragon Ball'' to ''Dragon Ball GT''.

Once selected the Future Warrior's race and/or gender cannot be changed, however the rest of their appearance can be changed by collecting the Dragon Balls and then summon Shenron at the [[Dragon Ball Pedestal]] in Toki Toki City then select the wish option ""''I want to be drop dead gorgeous!''"" which allows the warrior's hair (or other racial features such as horns, antenna, or a Majin's hair-like head tentacles), voice, height, eyes, face, mouth, ears, etc. to be changed. This wish is always available when Shenron is summoned thus it can be made more than once though the Dragon Balls must be collected again to make it again.

However, the Future Warrior's appearance in most artwork and promotional material is depicted as a young male Saiyan similar to adult [[Gohan]] in both facial features and hairstyle, but with red hair. He wears clothes similar to [[Future Trunks]]: an indigo [[Capsule Corporation]] jacket, gray pants, and golden boots. In addition, he wears a white cape similar to the one [[Tien Shinhan]] wears during the Majin Buu Arc and a green [[Scouter]]. [[Bandai Namco]] notes that it is quite intentional that he seems to have features from many other established characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bandai Namco]], E3, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, it is revealed this outfit is called the [[Time Patroller Suit]], a [[Time Patrol]] uniform for top Time Patrollers developed by the [[Capsule Corporation]] while the Scouter they wear in promotional material is '''New Model Scouter (Green)''' which is the same Scouter used by the [[Ginyu Force]]. In ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'', this character design appears under the name Ace and is the Future Warrior's default appearance among several that can be selected.

However, if the player uploads save data from ''Dragon Ball Xenoverse'', the Future Warrior will take on the appearance, gender, and race of the custom Future Warrior that has been uploaded from ''Xenoverse''.

Despite her young appearance, she is at least 75 million years old and was alive during the time period when Lord Beerus sealed [[Old Kai]] in the [[Z-Sword]], which would make her one of the oldest known living Supreme Kais.

Gohan's appearance changes drastically through ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', due to the fact that the series starts out with him as a child and ends when he is fully grown, married, and with a child of his own. But Gohan's basic physical appearance pretty much stays the same through the course of the series. Gohan has black hair and black eyes. He has his father's facial features, and also has his mother's light peach complexion rather than his father's light tan. Gohan also is quite muscularly developed for his age. As an adult, he looks slightly taller than Goku, but he is also a little bit thinner.

When Gohan is first introduced, he wears a child's outfit with his family name, 'Son', written on the front and the Four-Star Dragon Ball attached to his hat, the same Dragon Ball in which Goku believed that his grandpa's spirit resided.

[[File:GohanDebutNV.png|thumb|Gohan as a child]]
While training with [[Piccolo]], he wears an outfit similar to Goku's original, with the 'Ma' symbol (魔) [[King Piccolo]] wore. After training with Piccolo, he has a mullet-type haircut and dons a similar attire to the Namek warrior which he continues to wear until the end of the Captain Ginyu Saga, after which he wears [[Battle Armor]] given to him by [[Vegeta]]. He would continue to wear clothing similar to Piccolo's for the majority of his childhood, but his hair trended closer to his father's wild self-cut style. While training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, he begins wearing Saiyan training gear, but again reverts to Piccolo's clothing for the [[Cell Game]]s.

As a teenager, he alternates between a school uniform, his Great Saiyaman costume, a blue gi similar to the Piccolo clothing (except larger in size), a replica of the [[gi]] his father Goku wore while he was alive, and during the Buu Saga, he wears Kai clothing given to him by [[Kibito]]. His hair is much shorter and stands on end in a spiky formation.

In his first form, Frost bears a heavy resemblance to the first form of [[Frieza]], so much so that upon seeing him, [[Goku]] and [[Vegeta]] believe that he actually is Frieza. However, there are key differences from Frieza, most noticeably is that he is blue in skin color while his torso and head are pale-blue in color. Frost also does not have the full lips and wrinkles, has rounder and smoother ears, and does not have concentric circles in the skin around his arms. In addition, he only dons guards on his shoulders and at each hip, whereas Frieza wore a full torso of armor (though it is also possible that the ""guards"" are part of his skin). Frost's feet also differ in that he lacks Frieza's prehensile toes and appears to wear knee-hight boots and black pants, though they may be part of his body as well. Frost has modified his wrists to contain holes that conceal retractable needles.

His transformations also take on similar appearances respectably to Frieza's. When entering his Second Form (which is his equivalent to Frieza's Third Form), while still taller than his first form, it is still much shorter than Frieza's third form. Frost has only one set of horns, which retains its shiny black appearance, and the back of his head is noticeably shorter than Frieza's. In his true form, much like Frieza's, Frost becomes very sleek and unimposing in appearance, regressing to the same height as his first form. His neck and face turn pale blue like his torso and head. Also, in his final form, Frost's arms and legs remain their previous colouring, unlike Frieza's pure body coloring in his true form. His wrists become smooth as well.

[[File:GokuAndVegetaWMATNV.png|thumb|left|Goku and Vegeta's height difference.]]
Vegeta is a slim yet well-built man of a below-average stature. His hair is black (MANGA: ""[[The Needs of the Many]]"" onwards) or dark brown (ANIME: ""[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Gohan%27s_Rage Gohan's Rage]"", ""[[Terror on Arlia]]"") spiky and it firmly stands upwards and has a prominent widow's peak. Like most Saiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a near-consistently stern look to them and his hair is a shade of black. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile brown-furred tail, until it was permanently cut off by Yajirobe. (MANGA: ""[[The Last Heartbeat]]"")

Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, [[Nappa]], he later seems to be somewhat taller and noticeably more muscular. His hair appears to be shorter and his facial features, which are perpetually in a scowl, also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making him look way older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in the Raditz Saga.

[[File:Vegetapan-1-.jpg|thumb|left|Vegeta in his first appearances on Earth as he prepares to do battle with Goku]]
A major characteristic of Vegeta's is the fact that he is the only living Saiyan who has continued to don a traditional [[Battle Armor|Saiyan armor]]. His general look is a dark blue, full-bodied jumpsuit with white gloves and boots with the said armor on top. He has also been seen wearing alternate forms of the armor, customizing the armor to better suit his persona. When first arriving on Earth, he wore a white armor with yellow shoulder pads and also padding at his hips and nether-region. Along with it, he wore a red-lens scouter on his left eye. During the Frieza Saga, he replaced his heavily damaged armor with a similar one, minus the padding around his waistline. He also briefly wore another scouter until deeming it unnecessary. When his armor was damaged against Recoome, he replaced his outfit was and older model design consisting of a black bodysuit, white gloves and boots, and a near-purely white armor without shoulder pads. During the Androids Saga, he wore an updated version of his original armor, but without pads. During the Buu Saga, to be allowed to fight Goku in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Vegeta fought without armor and his bodysuit had no sleeves.

[[File:Rof vegeta.jpg|thumb|Vegeta in ''Resurrection ‘F’'']]
As he continued to integrate into Earthling society, he abandons the armor, wearing a dark blue sleeveless jumpsuit while retaining the white gloves and boots, then in ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', in favor of clothing more characteristic of a Earthling (Vegeta's uniform transition is symbolic of his adjustment to a Earthling lifestyle) such as a crimson tank top, violet gloves, dark blue jeans and violet boots along with a sleeveless black leather jacket. He also cropped his hair, which still spikes upward, and grew a mustache (until he mortified by Bulla insulting him for it). However, in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', he returns to wearing the same armor he wore during the Androids/Cell Sagas. During the early part of his training under Whis, Vegeta wore a new armor made by Bulma, which changes to have a grey bodysuit and a sleeker armor. [[Whis]] also placed his insignia the left of armor's chest.

[[File:Prison_Planet_Vegeta.png|thumb|left|Vegeta in the Prison Planet Saga]]
When he appears in the [[Prison Planet Saga]], Vegeta is back to wearing his ''[[Resurrection ‘F’]]'' armor, but with a Capsule Corp logo in place of Whis' symbol.

His Arkham Knight outfit seems to be a combination of his old comic book look and his Arkham Asylum cloths.

He suffered from severe injuries due to the attack by Croc, serving as one of the reasons for his long absence from Gotham. Using his injuries to his advantage in order to truly become one with his alter ego, Crane reconstructed his face by sewing his mask into his skin, making it his true face. It should also be noted, that in the entire Arkham series Scarecrow's real face was never fully shown.

His afro was revealed after using his Devil Fruit powers and having his cap knocked off. Ironically, prior to the timeskip, despite already being an elderly man upon his debut (being 77 years old at the time, thereby making him a year older than Garp and Rayleigh, both men being from his generation), Sengoku displayed little to no physical signs of his actual age, with his hair still not having grayed after 20 years.   

He typically wears black-rimmed glasses and a white and gold full Marine admiral uniform that is adorned with medals. The most distinctive features of this uniform are a life-size seagull on top of his cap, and his oversized Marine coat which he wears like a cape. His coat has the kanji for justice, in blue, emblazoned on the back, and has unique colored cuffs, with his being white.

In addition, his right arm is armored, with his shoulder being covered by a plate pauldron, all held in place by a harness across his chest. He also wears a pair of black gloves.

His regular outfit after the timeskip is mostly the same as two years ago. However, he now wears a vertically striped black and white sleeveless shirt that has the same orange symbol as his luchador mask and he now wears a pair of brown gloves. In Dressrosa, he also carries a green bag which has swirly patterns on it.

After battling Sabo, he received several injuries including a bone sticking out of one of his legs, which has some of the flesh and muscles on his leg burned off completely. It appears he also lost some or all parts of his mask which he had to obscure.

https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki,Doc Q,"
Doc Q, like the rest of his crewmates, is a very large man and is always seen traveling on the back of his horse [[Stronger]], who is, similarly, an unusually large horse. His nose is slightly longer than normal, his face appears always unshaven, and there are straight purple tattoos coming from his hairline to the corners of his eyes. He has long and ash blonde hair, and constantly has a pallid look about him acting as though he is on the verge of death.

He is seen wearing a black fur coat, a wide-brimmed, black beaten hat, and what appears to be a dark white hangman's noose around his neck. He would appear to wear a green turtleneck, and from under his coat sprouts what looks to be a brown robe, under which his hairy legs are visible. He has black, large-buckled shoes. On his back he carries a long, cylindrical bag, in which he keeps his scythe. His overall appearance resembles that of a stereotypical undertaker from Western fictions. Also, his pale skin, rather thin body, dark clothing, and use of a scythe is very similar to the typical Western image of a [[Wikipedia:Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]; befitting of his epithet.

As he is by his own admission very sick, this trait often shows on his expressions, as he commonly shows some level of pain and exhaustion, and sometimes stops during the middle of his sentences to cough. His chronic sickness is severe enough that he even has a gruesome tendency to bleed from his mouth. Despite these health problems, he also displays occasional smiles on matters he finds impressive.

He has a long face with black stripe-like patterns for a beard and hairstyle. His legs are relatively thin in comparison to his muscular arms. He appears battle-hardened and has a perpetual scowl on his face. The dark armor he wears and his hair style are very similar to that of an [[Wikipedia:Aztec|Aztec]] warrior, with red-bolted darl shoulder pads (the bolts were later changed to gray). On his chest he has a green cuirass, whose front and back portions are connected by metal straps that go over both his collarbones. The cuirass' color was later changed to a rusty red color. Around his waist there is a big, elaborated golden belt, worn over what looks like a green skirt similar to the ones worn by Aztecs, with golden decorations near the edge. He also wears what look like studded, black and gold large-buckled shoes or boots and matching black studded pants.

https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki,Pacifista,"
All the Pacifista replicas seen thus far have been identical in appearance to Bartholomew Kuma, even in his uncommon body proportion. The only distinguishing features between them and the genuine article are the lack of a Bible and Kuma's [[Nikyu Nikyu no Mi]] palm pads, though the latter is not initially apparent as they all wear similar gloves. Each Pacifista is considered to be a copy of Kuma, except for the original one who was gradually converted into a Pacifista. The Pacifista have the voice of Kuma, furthering their genuine replication to him. They are under complete control of the World Government.

Their appearances are so convincing that [[pirates]] unfamiliar with the genuine article believe they are the real Kuma. The [[Straw Hat Pirates]], having previously fought Kuma, were able to tell the difference eventually. Likewise, [[X Drake]], a former [[rear admiral]] familiar with the project, was aware of its nature. Some [[New World]] pirates are aware of Vegapunk's experiments, and that he sent several prototypes to handle incidents in the past, but were surprised that they were all modeled after Kuma.

All Pacifista are labeled by the letters ""PX"", then a hyphen and a number, presumably indicating the order in which they were constructed. The label is printed on the right side of their necks. There appears to be around twenty of them in service as of the [[Summit War of Marineford|Marineford War]], though it is unknown how many have been destroyed and built since then.

https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki,World Noble,"
World Nobles wear their hair, or a part of it, combed upward with a distinct curl on top, unless they do not have enough hair to do so, as Mjosgard's father is partially bald. They all wear the same kind of white robe that resembles a spacesuit (sometimes accompanied by a cape) with a skirt, although the border designs of each Noble's clothing appear somewhat different and original and there are variations in the skirt's length. Male World Nobles seem to have a different style of collar than female World Nobles. While outside [[Mary Geoise]], World Nobles wear an oxygen tank attached to a bubble or glass case around their head in order to not breathe the same air as the ""lowly commoners"". However, some are less likely to do so while in Mary Geoise, though others still feel the need to. A majority of World Nobles, such as Jalmack, Charlos, Mjosgard and his father, are notably overweight, if not outright obese. A typical Celestial Dragon also has a rather haughty, if not arrogant, look on their face, showing neither pity nor sympathy for those of lesser statuses.

When Homing's branch of the Donquixote Family abandoned their statuses, they ceased wearing their World Noble attire, and changed their hairstyles as well. Notably, even before their departure, this family alone seemed to have no members who are overweight and had rather remarkably kind facial features (except Doflamingo, who possesses the same, nigh-perpetual arrogant look as his amoral former brethren). The male members all grew up to be rather tall.{{Qref|name",their hair top enough hair to do so white robe a cape a skirt border each Noble's clothing the skirt's collar an oxygen tank attached to a bubble or glass case around their head their World Noble attire their hairstyles

He wears armor on his relatively thin legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows, respectively. The openings to both the gloves and the boots are also secured by the armor, which is rounded for the gloves and a sharp maple leaf pattern for the boots at the front of his knees.

https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki,Scratchmen Apoo,"
Being of the [[Longarm Tribe]] from the Grand Line, one of Apoo's distinguishing traits is his incredibly long arms. Each of these long arms possesses two elbow joints instead of just one, making them much longer than a normal person's. These arms make it possible for him to utilize his [[Devil Fruit]] powers without the need to contort the said limbs, whenever he converts them into makeshift instruments.

Apoo also has a rather broad chest cavity, which may aid him in producing deep and bellowing drum-like sounds. Apoo's lower jaw is also somewhat wider than the upper half of his face, similar to [[Itomimizu]] of the [[Foxy Pirates]]. Besides these, his most distinguishing attributes are his unique physical characteristics and the objects adorned on him, all of which are music themed or related. His teeth have a unique look to them as they resemble piano keys. His fighting stance is also music themed as he appears like he's moving his hands in the same way a DJ would move theirs when mixing music on turntables.

He wears a set of orange headphones with his name on either side over his ears and hairstyle similar to [[Jabra]]'s, where the hair on his scalp has been pulled tightly so that his roots resemble lightning patterns. Before the time skip, the portion of hair at the center of his forehead was, while spiky, flattened into a square shape. After the timeskip, the center portion of his hair resembled a triangle shape while the side strips were more straightened as opposed to appearing like lightning bolts. During the [[Fire Festival]], the side strips of hair as well as the center portion all resembled lightning bolts.

Apoo wears a red Chinese garb with his crew's [[Jolly Roger]] {{Nihongo|音||oto|""sound"" or ""music""}}, at the center of a large flower-like print splayed across the chest area, as well as on his back. Apoo also has a yellow scarf around his waist. He also has what seems to be the design of a green rose sewed on front of his left shoulder.

In [[SBS Volume 64]], Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Apoo is shown with significantly shorter hair and a rounder face. His hair was also combed into a pompadour in the front, with his braid in the back. His attire was a less elaborate shirt and bow tie.

Apart from his smile, he also has what appears to be a stitched-up scar vertically descending over, and falling short just above his left eye. On his chin he has a prominent, jet-black, and scruffy beard that extends upwards to the sides of his jaw and then converges with his equally-dark side-burns. He seems to sport the short and clean-cut sort of hairstyle generally sported by monks. He also has black tattoos going down his shoulders that somewhat resemble fire.

He dresses in similar robes to [[Divine Soldiers]] underneath the khaki robes he wears (which is also worn by the rest of his crew), which includes the white full-bodied garment with severed sleeves, that exposes tattoos patterned like flames on both biceps.

Almost anything can become a Homie with the exception of corpses and humans, so their appearance can be incredibly varied. Any inanimate object imaginable can become a Homie after having a piece of a soul infused into it regardless of shape or size, as shown with the living furniture, ships and talking buildings that inhabit Totto Land. Food of all types can also become Homies, however the majority of food-based Homies seen are all sweets and pastries which is fitting considering Totto Land's sweet environment. Even more fantastical is the fact that even natural scenery can become a Homie, such as plants, terrain, clouds and even what seems to be a miniature living sun. Animals who are infused with human souls gain human-like attributes, such as talking, standing up-right and wearing clothes, which make them resemble members of the [[Mink Tribe]], however they cannot use [[Electro]] and animal-type Homies can be both mammals and reptiles.

https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki,Nefertari Vivi,"
Vivi is a young woman with long wavy light blue hair, with two locks hanging down, one on either side of her head, which started out at about chin-length but were past her shoulders by her last appearance before the timeskip. She most often wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, and brown eyes. She has a slender body but tends to wear less-revealing clothing than [[Nami]] and [[Nico Robin|Robin]] do. Vivi has been seen wearing several different high heeled shoes, including white high heel boots, white high heel sandals, and blue wedges.

Though she is a princess, she rarely wore clothing that would suggest her royal status while traveling with the Straw Hats, although she started to do so more regularly after her coming-of-age speech.

After the time-skip, she wears her hair down but held back by a clip, and it seems a bit shorter than before. Like most female characters since the timeskip, her hourglass figure has become more pronounced.

A notable facet of her appearance is that when she was a member of [[Baroque Works]], she seemed to have been drawn in a slightly different way. While playing the role of Miss Wednesday, she looked older, and her facial features were much more angular. She wore her ponytail in a very high position until she was attacked by [[Mikita|Miss Valentine]], where a few strands of her hair were slashed off with her hair bead. It was only after she allied herself with the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] that she was drawn to look more like a teenage girl, with slightly bigger/rounder facial features and a less shapely body. This was more noticeable in the anime than the manga, as the animators drew her in such a different way that she could almost be mistaken for another character.

As a child, she had shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail.

During the [[Reverse Mountain Arc|Reverse Mountain]] and [[Whisky Peak Arc|Whisky Peak]] Arcs, she wears a shirt with dark blue and white circles (light blue and dark blue stripes in the anime), shorts fastened with a belt, and a white coat.

During the [[Little Garden Arc]], she wears a light green long-sleeve shirt with blue lines, white shorts, and white boots.

At the beginning of the [[Drum Island Arc]], she exchanges the shirt she wore in [[Little Garden]] for a maroon sweatshirt. Once they arrive in a cold climate zone, she begins to wear warm clothing, wearing a white coat with pink shoulder pads, long blue pants, and yellow gloves. After leaving [[Drum Island]], she wears a dotted shirt with a neckline (a shirt with green squares with suspenders in the anime).

At the beginning of the [[Arabasta Arc]], she wears a pink short-sleeved shirt with blue shoulders and a drawing of three X on a line. When they arrive at [[Arabasta]], she is wearing a dancer outfit with a green and yellow top and long skirt (blue and pink in the anime), and a light blue scarf (white in the anime). Subsequently, she wears a dark blue desert outfit. At the end of the Arc, she wears a princess outfit, with a white and pink dress with suspenders, with gold ornaments and accessories. Also from that moment she stops wearing her hair in a ponytail.

During the [[Post-Enies Lobby Arc]], she wears a light pink shirt with dark pink lines and figures, and a white skirt.

Two years later, when she attends the [[Levely]], she wears a long-sleeved pink dress, with gold accessories at the waist and arms, and a cape, red on the outside and dark blue on the inside.

https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki,Proto Man,"
Proto Man appears similar to his younger brother, Mega Man, having a similar frame and build although the differences are immediate. Proto Man wears vibrant red armor that sharply contrasts that of Mega Man's blue shades as well as having a dark gray body suit. He wears a stylized helmet that features a distinct white trim that points upward. Along with his trademark flowing yellow scarf and thick black sunglasses makes Proto Man fit the mysterious dashing lone wolf archetype quite well. Like Mega Man, Proto Man has been seen without his helmet, his hair having inconsistent depictions within and outside of canon.

In ''Mega Man 3'' and the ''Rockman Complete Works'' version of ''Mega Man 5'', Proto Man is depicted with short hair. However, in ''Mega Man 8'', his hair is longer, featuring a distinct, long fringe that stretches forward and curves slightly upward, and in the ''Megamix'' manga, he is given exactly the same hairstyle as Mega Man. Archie comics gave him the ''Rockman 8'' hair style and left it there, although one of the Short Circuits comics (specifically, [[Mariachi]], the one taking place in Issue 9), taking place before Blues' formal debut, and Issue 54 depicted him with the short hairstyle from ''Mega Man 3'' and the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Rockman Complete Works'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' version of ''Mega Man 5''. His hair is changed back to the Rockman 8 version in Issue 55.

MegaMan stands at 148 virtual centimeters (roughly 4'9""), which is small compared to other NetNavis. He has indigo biceps, with cyan stripes down his sides, ending at his blue boots which are tipped with black soles. He has two yellow shoulder guards and his blue helmet has two ridges running along the top. These ridges come to a stop at the helmet's base and allows his dark hair to stick out in four spikes. He has green eyes and a overall human appearance. As a customized NetNavi, MegaMan sports the symbol of the Hikari family on his chest and both sides of his helmet. This symbol is a red circle with a black line running diagonally through the center which ends in two triangles, all of which are surrounded by a gold ring.

In battle, MegaMan is shown with a mask covering his mouth and nose when in battle and in some of the [[Battle Chip]]s with images of him. In the anime and manga, he only wears the mask sometimes, then completely abandoning using them outside of forms later on.

As Hub Hikari, MegaMan has brown hair with swayed back bangs and his usual hair spikes are more wavy.

Zero describes Vile as a Reploid who was designed to be a war machine.&lt;ref&gt;''""X, you shouldn't expect to defeat him, he is designed to be a war machine.""'' - Zero, ''Mega Man X''&lt;/ref&gt; Vile is adorned in basic armor with a distinct purple sheen and gold highlights. Like some Maverick Hunters, Vile wears a helmet with a T-shaped visor that conceals his face in shadow. It is unknown if this ''is'' his face or if it just hides his real face, as in the ''[[Mega Man X3]]'' opening video, his ''Mega Man X3'' artwork, the ''[[Rockman X (manga)|Rockman X3]]'' manga and the Ruby-Spears cartoon, Vile is seen with a singular glowing eye. Attached to his shoulder is a cannon featuring an ammo belt arching into a pack on his back.    

Vile's later appearances retain the overall basic appearance, always featuring his signature T-shaped visor and shoulder cannon, but take on different color schemes with stylized accents. In ''Mega Man X'' and ''X3'', his shoulder cannon was incorporated directly into his shoulderpad, while in ''X8'' and ''Maverick Hunter X'', it was attached to his back and sat behind his shoulderpad. This design is retained in ''Rockman X DiVE''.

Gate is a tall male Reploid in purple armor. His clear face is recognizable for his sharp purple eyes and a confident expression. Facially, Gate appears to be slightly older than X and Zero. His helmet is distinguished by a pair of metallic blades running across the sides and a diamond shaped blue gem. Another blue gem with the shape of a pentagon is located on the center of his chestplate. He is more defined however by his white lab coat featuring gold accents and cuffs. He wears a long white labcoat, adorned by golden bands around the collar and the wrists.

In combat, Gate changes to a golden armor with white details and blue gems, and his labcoat becomes a cape, which he implies after the battle was the result of his research into the Zero Virus.

She wears an odd, egg-shaped helmet with a jewel in the center; however, what appears to be an egg-shaped helmet actually separates into two pieces, as first seen when Pandora takes the passwords from [[Model X]] and [[Model Z]]. Her white, blue and black scheme strongly contrasts that of her brother as well. Like Prometheus, her armor color changes when she uses an elemental attack; however, she has two color changes instead of one: a yellow and blue scheme for Thunder attacks and a light blue one for Ice attacks. She will attack with both elements if white-colored.

https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki,Copy X,"
Copy X, as his name would suggest, is (in his own words) a perfect copy of Mega Man X, although with some differences. The most noticeable of these are his red eyes, which help establish his role as primary antagonist and his distinct differences in ideology from the original X. In battle, he dons his [[Ultimate Armor]], which changes his base color scheme from predominately blue to white and gold, with the exception of his helmet. The armor allows him to change elemental affinities (the matching color motifs are noticeable with his helmet changing color), and it also gives him the ability to use a guided [[Nova Strike]]. The armor also becomes adorned with an angel-like motif, with two wing-like extensions protruding from the upper back, an additional five from the helmet, and a final two from the sides of the [[X-Buster]]. The armor's imagery here likens him to the [[Wikipedia:Seraph|Seraphim of Judaism]], who were said to be the highest-ranking angels, and this was signified by their six wings.

This casts Copy X, who believes himself to be a savior and a hero, in an arrogant, self-praising light. This is a sharp contrast with X himself (now a [[Cyber-elf]]), who also appears angelic, but in a much more modest manner; he simply wears a cassock over his armor with a blue and light grey halo that rains all colors of the palette appearing above his head, and has no visible wings. Cyber-elf X also has a different helmet design when compared to Copy X, with the latter's helmet staying much closer to its original design in all of his forms.

After transforming into his presumed [[Armed Phenomenon]] form, Copy X completely reforms himself into a much larger being. While his upper body mostly stays the same, his lower body completely disappears and his arms detach from his body, becoming large and clawed, and six large wings appear on his back, creating a striking resemblance to a Seraph. This divine, angelic appearance is sharply contrasted by the demonic red glare in his eyes. He traps his enemy with halo-like rays and tries to purge them with searing flame set off by lasers from his eyes, further emphasizing the resemblance.

She wears a red transceiver headset with a bit of a receiver-like design. Her upper arms, midriff and bottom part of her breasts, and parts of her thighs are covered in a clear body suit, while her chest is mostly covered by a white armored plate. Combined with her weapon of choice, Layer gives off a refined and professional air.

In Rockman X DiVE's 2020 summer event, a variant of her called Swimsuit Layer was featured. Swimsuit Layer wears a blue and white bikini with high heels, and her hair is set in a ponytail.

Combined with his long and blond curly hair, Elpizo appears as a refined gentleman. It is unknown what he looked like before gaining his unique name.

Upon absorbing the Dark Elf's power, his appearance radically changed, with his fingers becoming more clawlike, a more skeletal-like white armor, and jagged military shoulder cuffs. His face also becomes noticeably paler, as well as gaining red eyes characteristic of that of mavericks. The only aspect of his original form that was retained was his hair and his beret.

Absorbing more of the Dark Elf's power granted him a more demonic form with spindly arms, a jagged mask, and bat-like wings that bore some resemblance to a large Cyber elf. The only thing retained in this form was his characteristic hair, only it is now billowing without any support from the wind, enhancing his current demon-like nature.

However, the sprite of X in [[Yggdrasil]] in ''[[Mega Man Zero 2]]'' seems to give X ""''Mega Man Zero'' style"" limbs. Additional concept art of Cyber-elf X depicts him without his robe or halo, and seemingly slimmer body type. But since this art only shows X's body partially, it is impossible to tell what the rest of it looks like.

In game, he is always seen with a sword in hand (which is notably not of the plasma sort), however it is never used in battle. Interestingly, his ear pieces have been given earring-like attachments.

Due to Aeolus's hair style, which covers his forehead (the location of the possible red triangle identifying Reploids), it is impossible to tell if he is human/humanoid or Reploid.

His wings are huge with respect to the rest of the body and features five fingers, with two additional claws on the top, one at the carpometacarpal joint, the other presumably at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the longest finger.

The patagia are dark purple at the top, gradually becoming red at the bottom. The body is fully covered by big scales, while its lower part until the head is covered by bigger plates and has a lighter pink color. The Ruined Dragon has a long neck and a head with a long muzzle.

His mouth has gums fully covered by teeth and features a long and thin tongue, curved at the tip. His eyes are round and feature a black sclera, irises which are yellow with a red border and black vertical slit pupils. He features on the back of each side of the head two horns pointing backward which are segmented and doubly curved, with the upper horn being bigger than the lower one, and in general the whole head is covered by smaller horns, two of them have the shape of teeth and are found almost at the end of the muzzle.

The head also features a peculiar segmentation forming vertical bands which are more visible on the lower part of the muzzle. The upper tip of the muzzle is slightly protruding and features two relatively small nostrils.

When first meeting him, the Ruined Dragon is seen wearing a golden crown featuring the shape of Bowser's head on it, as well as various horns and a black cloth with golden motifs similar to the ones seen in [[Bowser's Kingdom]], which is kept into place by chains that are fixed to the dragon's head through some golden sword-shaped pins, identical to the sword-shaped stakes found in Crumbleden.

Compared to other dragons (and most creatures in general) in the ''Mario'' franchise, the Ruined Dragon has a more ""realistic"" design, with detailed textures and little cartoonish exaggeration, just like the [[Ruined Kingdom]] he's found in.

https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki,Nightmare,"
True to his nickname, Nightmare appears as a dark figure covered in dark blue armor that covers most of his body. His prominent feature is his right arm, which has been twisted and transformed into a large three-digit claw whose flesh overlaps his entire right arm and shoulder. He is depicted with Soul Edge in his left hand, symbolizing his polarity with [[Siegfried]]. Over the years, his appearance has progressively grown more and more demonic, as influenced by the state of Soul Edge himself. During the events of ''Soulcalibur'', he was simply a suit of armor with a giant arm and horned helmet. In ''Soulcalibur II'', Nightmare's armor changes design, now sporting long red hair from the back with bat wing-like ornaments on the sides replacing the horn. With a body to call his own at last, Nightmare returned to a suit similar to his original ''Soulcalibur'' variant, although slightly re-vamped, in ''Soulcalibur III'', with the claw having stretched over his chest plate, possessing a rudimentary jaw lined with sharp teeth both on his shoulder and chest.

As of ''Soulcalibur IV'', Nightmare seems to have degraded into a body of dark energy. What was once flesh has now fully transformed into a compound of metal and bone. The mouth covering the chestplate from before has split open around his entire waist, connecting the legs and torso with a torrent of evil energy. The armor appears fused to his claw and much more metallic in appearance. No longer using Siegfried, the alternate costumes are much more severe in mutation. His alternate outfit in ''Soulcalibur IV'' displays traits similar to [[Night Terror]].

Following the destruction of the original Nightmare, Soul Edge obtains a new host in ''Soulcalibur V'', resulting in the rise of a new Nightmare. His design returns to a more traditional look best likened to his appearance in ''Soulcalibur II''. He retains the long horn on his helmet from his other designs, and both the horn and parts of his arm display a menacing orange glow. Despite having a new host, he retains his fighting style from past games. Soul Edge, like Nightmare himself, has also reverted to a design more like its appearance in earlier titles, despite having a different official design for the game. In Legendary Souls, the ''Soulcalibur IV'' version of Nightmare appears as one of the opponents, albeit the dark energy and smoke being replaced with flames, resembling [[Inferno]] to an extent.

In ''Soulcalibur VI'', Nightmare is given a redesign from his ''Soulcalibur'' appearance, not only featuring yellow trims from his later designs, but now having upward-facing fins on his helmet and his breastplate being pointed. He also now wears a cape, similar to an art render from ''Soulcalibur''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Art Gallery. As the game features battle damage, Nightmare's helmet can be knocked off, revealing Siegfried's face and shoulder-length blond hair underneath, though his eyes continue to produce the same glow.

In the spin off ''Soulcalibur Legends'', Nightmare's appearance is taken from ''Soulcalibur III'' but it noticeably more demonic, with his greaves having developed talons and his right leg having taken on the form of a large jaw, similar to his right shoulder.

https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki,Raphael,"
Raphael appears as a fairly young man of French noble descent, having blue eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair. In his first appearance, he wore an indigo jacket with black lining and red inner workings, matching gloves and black pants with red highlights. Tied around his waist is a long red sash. In ''Soulcalibur III'', the influence of [[Soul Edge]] had changed his body to resemble something of a vampire, featuring paler skin and red coloured eyes, part of his hair swept up with another styled in a fringe that covers half his face, and a slightly more muscular build. He then wore a green jacket with a collared cape, both which feature red inner workings and gold lining with an armor plate beneath. In ''Soulcalibur IV'', he wore a mostly black ensemble featuring a two-tailed high-collared coat with gold lining and an elaborate white frill decorating with a bat emblem on it, making him resemble [[w:c:castlevania:Castlevania Wiki|Castlevania]]'s [[w:c:castlevania:Alucard|Alucard]]. His eyes remained red.

As of ''Soulcalibur V'', it appears he has not aged at all. The outfit he is wearing has a very similar silhouette to his ''Soulcalibur II'' costume with the addition of a black wide-brimmed hat. He also wears his bat ornaments upside down. The reason for this is still unknown and might never be explained, but it can be surmised the wide-brimmed hat is in reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Hunter_D Vampire Hunter D] artwork done by [http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano Yoshitaka Amano]. Like D, Raphael is vampiric in nature and, as of ''Soulcalibur V'', can be assumed to be a tormented figure.

He has the the most secondary outfits out of any character in the [[soul series]] within one game. His red attire is taken from both the Goron Tunic of ''Ocarina of Time,'' the blue one is taken from both the Blue Mail from ''A'' ''Link to the Past'' and Zora Tunic in ''Ocarina of Time,'' which in the SNES game was the first defense upgrade and in the N64 title gave him the ability to breathe underwater. The violet one is taken from the Blue Ring's effect from the original NES game which was the first defense upgrade.

https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki,Inferno,"
In his first appearance, in [[Soul Edge (game)|Soul Blade]], Inferno appeared similar to [[Cervantes/Original Timeline|Cervantes]], wearing the same chestplate, jacket, boots and gloves, but the rest of his body was entirely composed of purple flames and his head was a devilish skull. His alternate color schemes include traditional orange flames, blue flames, and green flames.

In [[Soulcalibur]], he returns the fiery composite appearance but his head has taken on a half-dome shape and has developed hardened limbs with claws and two-toed talons with electricity surging around them. This is finished off by what appears to be a scarf of fire on his back. Following the console version, this was removed. As a playable character however, he is given a flexible, somewhat metallic sheen, as if to appear as crystallized magma, due to processing problems that prevented the original version from being playable.

In [[Soulcalibur II]], he is given a more tangible appearance with his entire body being a composite of bone and exposed flesh and is as tall as [[Astaroth/Original|Astaroth]] In his head and chest is [[Soul Calibur]] herself lodged deep within his body. Transformed by Inferno's influence, she contains an eye and wings sprouting from above the hilt. Flames still cover his entire body but they can now be knocked off although they will still linger on.

In [[Soulcalibur III#Soulcalibur III: Arcade Edition|Soulcalibur III: Arcade Edition]], his flames are still red in color, he has Metallic Feet, Metallic Shin Guards, Metallic Armor, Metallic Gauntlets and Metallic Skullheads.

In Soulcalibur VI, he features a mixture of his Soulcalibur and Soulcalibur II designs as a tall demonic skeletal monster with crimson flames engulfing his body. He also has a fully defined skull with glowing eyes and horns.

https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki,Algol,"
In his debut appearance, he appeared as a man of peak Olympian physique, thick eyebrows and long, black hair tied together in a set of accented braids each ending in a sharp hair piece. Ancient tattoos were also adorned on his torso and he bore a large scar on the left side of his face. Following his resurrection, his hair became a pure white and his eyes became a glowering yellow and also possessed long fingernails while his hands constantly emit a red and blue aura, right and left, respectively, due to the power of [[Soul Edge]] and [[Soul Calibur]] coursing through his veins. His arms also bear distinct large scars which open up to reveal the weapons hidden in his body. He can also change his hands into the forms of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur as well as a pair of energy cannons. Design-wise, Algol was designed in mind to be a character whose wardrobe was so ancient that it was not recorded in history. As such he wore a dark breastplate, bird-shaped shoulder pads, a long scaled fauld with a thick drape of cloth lined by various ancient characters and talon grieves and a pair of bracelets. The outfit is complete with a long scarf tied around his neck with the majority of it hanging behind his back. Combined with the weapon structures in his body, he overall invokes an apt bird-like theme to compliment his ancient nature.

Following ''Soulcalibur V'', Algol has done away with his armor to show off his full physique and wears a similar cloth with a much lighter shade and shows his feet possessing talons, as well as having darker skin than he did in ''Soulcalibur IV''.

https://soulcalibur.fandom.com/wiki,Voldo/Original Timeline,"
Due to his appearance, Voldo is considered as an oddity, even among the ''Soul series''' cast. Following his debut appearance in ''Soul Edge'', all of his costumes had a very direct approach to the sado-masochistic slave theme which is associated with him. Voldo almost always wears a leather harness, which resembles a head trainer, covering his eyes and mouth. Most of his costumes also include other fetish elements, such as spikes, strings tied tightly around his body, thongs revealing his buttocks and parts of his costumes are made from see-through fishnet. In ''Soul Calibur IV'' his initial concept even had a ball gag, but this wasn't included in the game, possibly due to its offensiveness or to avoid a higher rating. His final design in ''Soul Calibur IV'' includes an element from his 2P costume from ''Soul Edge'' - monoculars. However, in this costume, he has three of them, two where his eyes should be and one in the middle of his forehead.

Voldo's ''Soul Calibur V'' outfit is seemingly less bondage themed, though he does sport a very outlandish suspender depicting a spider. When he loses the colorful fur during battle, it's revealed that he's dressed in his usual way.

Raphael appears as a fairly young man of French noble descent, having blue eyes and shoulder length blonde hair. In his first appearance, he wore an indigo jacket with black lining and red inner workings, matching gloves and black pants with red highlights. Tied around his waist is a long red sash. In ''Soulcalibur III'', the influence of [[Soul Edge]] had changed his body to resemble something of a vampire, featuring paler skin and red coloured eyes, part of his hair swept up with another styled in a fringe that covers half his face, and a slightly more muscular build. He then wore a green jacket with a collared cape, both which feature red inner workings and gold lining with an armor plate beneath. In ''Soulcalibur IV'', he wore a mostly black ensemble featuring a two-tailed high-collared coat with gold lining and an elaborate white frill decorating with a bat emblem on it, making him resemble [[w:c:castlevania:Castlevania Wiki|Castlevania]]'s [[w:c:castlevania:Alucard|Alucard]]. His eyes remained red.

As of ''Soulcalibur V'', it appears he has not aged at all. The outfit he is wearing has a very similar silhouette to his ''Soulcalibur II'' costume with the addition of a black widebrimmed hat. He also wears his bat ornaments upside down. The reason for this is still unknown and might never be explained, but it can be surmised the widebrimmed hat is in reference to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Hunter_D Vampire Hunter D] artwork done by [http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano Yoshitaka Amano]. Like D, Raphael is vampiric in nature and, as of ''Soulcalibur V'', can be assumed to be a tormented figure.

In [[Soulcalibur]], he returns the fiery composite appearance but his head has taken on a half-dome shape and has developed hardened limbs with claws and two-toed talons with electricity surging around them. This is finished off by what appears to be a scarf of fire on his back. Following the console version, this was removed. As a playable character however, he is given a flexible, somewhat metallic sheen, as if to appear as crystallized magma, due to processing problems that prevented the original version from being playable.

In [[Soulcalibur II]], he is given a more tangible appearance with his entire body being a composite of bone and exposed flesh and is as tall as [[Astaroth/Original|Astaroth]] In his head and chest is [[Soul Calibur]] herself lodged deep within his body.

Summer wears a fiery red dress and wheatears in her blonde hair. She looks about 25-30. Her voice is deeper, much less naive and much more flirty.
Autumn has some wrinkles, she's around 40-50. Yellow dress, black hair, red leaves in her hair. She's the most grumpy and annoyed one.
Winter is an old, gray-haired lady in a blue dress and a holly wreath.

And how could I forget the appearance of the champion? The silhoute? Well, I'll outline what I have preliminarily, but suggestions are always welcomed.

For now, the idea is that Nevon is a man in his mid-late 30s, with a lean build. However, due to the conditions of Zaun, along with all the work he has done, his physical looks have aged a bit more, so he would look like he's closer to {{tt|middle-aged|40s or even early 50s}} if not just a young man with saggy eyelids and some unusual wrinkles. While he has some cuts and scars, it's not something to the level of Singed, as that is not the focus of his looks.

His outfit is something ""casual-formal"" with a doctor's coat on. Something a doctor would wear. But the casual-formal also hides some clothes that is meant to be light-protection (this is Zaun right?); when he is outside of Zaun, he likely doesn't wear the coat, but instead some padding/armor that is travel-suitable. Aside from the large generator-pack that he has on his back that creates the Hextech Shelter/Bulwark and remedies, Nevon has one more noticeable item that seems to be machine in nature: a rebreather. To make differences from {{ci|Kassadin}} who requires his permanently, Nevon doesn't need to have his gas mask-like rebreather on 24/7. However, because of his physical condition, ""hiccups"" occur, and while he can just suffer through the pain, Nevon would rather use this handy rebreather to restabilize himself. It can be automatic by a button's touch, or something more manual, but surely not something that will modulate his voicelines all the time.

Speaking of voicelines, his voice surely isn't going to sound healthy, like some handsome VO. As mentioned, the conditions of Zaun and the situations Nevon has put himself in have caused him to ""age"" a bit, and the same applies to his voice. It won't be raspy like an old man, but there are distinct moments where one can hear supposed guttural sounds being projected, signs of a damaged throat (likely vocal chord dysfunction).

https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki,Goofy,"
Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog with black fur and droopy ears. His outfit in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series is a modified version of his basic outfit in the modern Disney cartoons; in fact, he wears his normal outfit in the opening of ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''. He has two bucked teeth and three short hairs coming out of the top of his head, just in front of his hat. Goofy's hat is orange (save for a blue band in the middle) and the top is an odd shape, resembling a teardrop placed on its side. There is a small pair of red goggles around the bottom of the hat as well (strangely, the lenses of these goggles seem to be quite a bit smaller than Goofy's eyes).

Goofy wears a green turtleneck sweater with sleeves that bell out slightly and a blue arrow-shaped strap on each cuff. He wears white gloves with a brown band around each wrist. Over the sweater, he wears a sleeveless, black combat vest with grey lining and four pockets of the same color. Goofy's pants are yellow and secured by a thick, black belt. They have rather large pockets and a pouch on each leg with a silver zipper. The legs of his pants have a peculiar style, with the bottom rims (which are dark orange) being pulled upward in the front by a brown strap. Goofy has very large shoes which are brown with steel toes on the outside.

In ''Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep'', Goofy is seen training with Donald and Mickey with Yen Sid in a significantly different outfit. His hat is now made of metal and resembles a knight's helmet, and sports a curved blade on the top. He wears armor over his body, though most of it is on his left side, leaving his right side mostly exposed except for a metal armlet on his upper arm. His left arm sports the same armlet, but includes several more pieces of armor, such as a pauldron over his left shoulder, a thick, cylindrical gauntlet covering most of the rest of his arm, and a metal glove overtop his normal white one.

Goofy's turtleneck is replaced with a sleeveless, orange shirt with a high, yellow collar. Overtop this, he wears an oblong, blue piece of clothing over his right half, held on by a black strap attached by yellow, star-shaped buttons. He wears a thick, metal belt around his waist with two blue straps looping around the back of it. Goofy's pants are baggy and orange with a noticeable seam down the front of each leg. The bottom of the legs are black with gold lining. Goofy's shoes, while equally as large as the were in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II'', are made of metal and the toes curl upward.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Ryu,"
Ryu's most recognizable attire consists of a white karate gi with the sleeves torn off, medium length hair, a long red headband, a black martial arts belt and bare feet (a choice he makes of his own, believing it to be more comfortable). In many of his appearances, Ryu carries around a large, white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets, passports, and local currency.

In the first ''[[Street Fighter]]'', Ryu wore a white headband and red shoes. Over the course of time, he has grown more muscular; his karate gi has grown more tattered, his gloves have changed from brown to red and his headband has changed from white to red. Most notably, his hair color has darkened over time; his original ''Street Fighter'' appearance gave him red hair, brown in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'', dark brown in ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', and black in ''[[Street Fighter III]]'', ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter V]]''. In the ''Street Fighter III'' series, Ryu’s black hair has a blue tint. The red headband Ryu wears was originally worn by [[Ken Masters|Ken]]. From ''Street Fighter IV'' onwards, the red gloves worn by Ryu have started to bear stylized writing, which resembles the ''[[Wikipedia:Fūrinkazan|Fūrinkazan]] ''characters on his belt.

In some official ''Street Fighter II'' artwork, Ryu's belt has four kanji emblazoned upon the right end: {{nihongo|''wind''|風|Kaze}}, {{nihongo|''forest''|林|Hayashi}}, {{nihongo|''fire''|火|Hi}} and {{nihongo|''mountain''|山|Yama}}; these four kanji make up the ''Fūrinkazan''. The same four kanji can be seen on a sign on the left-hand side of Ryu's stage in ''Street Fighter II'', and are also visible on his belt in ''Street Fighter IV''. The four words are based on chapter seven of [[Wikipedia:Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[wikipedia:Art of War|Art of War]]'', which dictates how one should conduct battle: ''""as fast as the wind, as quiet as the forest, as daring as fire, and immovable as the mountain.""''

In ''Street Fighter II V'', Ryu wears some casual outfits throughout the episodes; his primary appearance is a white short-sleeve shirt, blue denim jeans and red and white sneakers. He also has a black watch on his left wrist. Ryu is not wearing his red headband. When he wears his white karate gi, he only wears a brown prayer bead bracelet on his left wrist. He is also more tanned than in the games.

His second alternate costume in ''Street Fighter V'' consists of only his white karate pants with a black belt to his waist and tatters in the edge of his pants, gray shoulder bands on each side and hand wraps on his hands. He also has a black facial beard. 

This outfit later became his main outfit in ''[[Street Fighter 6]]'', his handwraps are replaced with brown gloves, his black belt now have white outlines and gained white wraps all over his stomach. He now wears brown wooden sandals as opposed being barefoot like in previous games. 

During E. Honda's character story, Ryu's black hair was pushed down by the warm water when he was meditating at his bathhouse. By the time he was battling Honda on his bathhouse before he gives him some proper manners after bathing, Ryu wears a white fundoshi without the rear apron and wears a white headband with the sign of red ""V"" mark at the center instead of his red headband. This also marks the first time to see more of Ryu's bare skin in his revealed appearance as his revealed outfit is the same revealing undergarments currently worn by ''Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness'' character, Jin Saotome beneath his main outfit in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' where he burns his clothes to show this outfit during execution of one of his special moves or his own taunt while drying himself with a white towel.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Gen,"
Gen is an elderly man who often has a stern look on his face. He is among the shortest male characters in the series, standing at just 5'5"". Gen wears a loose, purple outfit with a red sash around his clothes, and red Chinese martial art shoes with white socks. He has white hair with a long, white beard. In the original ''[[Street Fighter]]'', he had black pupils in his eyes, not to mention he didn't have the red sash, but in his more recent incarnations, his eyes are now completely white in color.

Prior to his recent appearance in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', Gen had short hair. In the ''Street Fighter IV'' games, his hair not only has grown much longer but he also keeps it tied in a formal bun at the back of his head (the bun in the ''Street Fighter IV'' series has a traditional qipao similar to [[Chun-Li]]'s ones, but is completely exposed in ''Street Fighter V'' artworks). In most recent games his skin also has aging wrinkles in his entire body, notably his face.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Sagat,"
Sagat is characterized by his intimidating appearance and towering muscular build. He wears Muay Thai trunks with colors varying from purple with yellow trim, to blue with red trim, to blue with yellow. He also wears the hand and feet wraps common to many Muay Thai practitioners.

[[File:Sagat-young.png|thumb|150px|A younger Sagat.]]
With 7 ft 5 (226 cm), Sagat is the fourth-tallest character in the whole ''[[Street Fighter series|Street Fighter]]'' franchise, behind [[T. Hawk]], [[Hugo]] and [[Abigail]]. There is evidence to suggest that Sagat's height was the result of him suffering from {{W|Gigantism}} disorder.

In his youth, Sagat used to have long hair, which is shown to be reddish-brown in one of his [[Alternate Costume|alternate costumes]] in ''Street Fighter IV''. Either he lost his hair over the years or intentionally shaved them off at some point. Additionally, he wore a {{W|Mongkhon}}.

Ever since Sagat's right eye was gouged out in his fight with [[Go Hibiki]] before the events of ''Street Fighter'', it is covered by a black eyepatch. Another notable injury was inflicted by [[Ryu]] during their fated fight in ''Street Fighter''; a massive diagonal scar across his chest. Oddly enough, the [[Street Fighter II V]] anime series depicts him with neither of these injuries.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Akuma,"
Akuma usually wears a dark-colored gi with the sleeves removed (similar to Ken and Ryu); it is often blue, black, or gray, but varies depending on the series or artwork. He has red hair with a topknot, sharp, pointed teeth, and is often bare-footed, though some games have him wearing brown sandals. Depending on the game or piece of art, he either wears a black belt at his waist or a length of rope. Over his hands he either wears brown training gauntlets or wraps his hands with rope as well (again, depending on the source). He has tanned skin and crimson eyes, and wears his deceased master [[Goutetsu]]'s prayer beads around his neck, with a visible black ""heaven"" (天, ''ten'') kanji on the center bead in some video games. In ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: Generations]]'', he was seen having eyebrows when he was young.

This kanji is featured frequently in Akuma's appearances, most often at the end of a [[Raging Demon]] attack, where it burns itself onto the back of Akuma's gi top. It takes on a slightly different shape between the original ''Street Fighter IV'' and ''Super Street Fighter IV''; the top stroke of the kanji is more narrow in ''Super Street Fighter IV'' than in the original, and may have taken this shape due to Akuma's 2nd alternate costume using exactly the same new shape on the back.

In his artwork for his ''Street Fighter V'' profile, Akuma's hair is completely white, and has grown out; he wears a dark yellow loincloth with a white sash on each side, going shirtless while retaining his gray karate pants. This is designed as a contrast to his older brother Gouken's outfit.

In his full appearance in ''Street Fighter V'', his hair has grown out considerably, resembling a lion's mane, though he retains his familiar clothing. He also has the hair on top of his head tied into a pigtail. He also wears his prayer beads like a sash. The 神人 ""shin"" kanji used by [[Shin_Akuma#Capcom_vs._SNK_2:_Mark_of_the_Millennium_2001|Shin Akuma in ''Capcom vs. SNK 2'']] is seen on his back when performing the Shun Goku Satsu.

His first alternate costume is similar to Ryu's alternate costume in ''Super Street Fighter IV''; where his tattered karate gi is hanging loose on his waist and his karate pants are also in tatters. His second alternate costume is his outfit in ''Street Fighter V'' artwork and his third and last outfit is his classic appearance in the ''Street Fighter'' games.

In the ''[[Street Fighter III series|Street Fighter III]]'' series his hair is slightly grayed, hinting that Akuma, while seemingly inhuman, is still physically aging.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Balrog,"
Balrog is a tall, heavily built and very muscular African-American boxer. He wears blue boxing trunks with white trim and a torn white shirt under a blue tank top, as well as red boxing gloves and boxing shoes. His short hairstyle is similar to Mike Tyson's haircut from the era of ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' 's release. Official artwork at the time also depicted him sans a canine tooth in the upper right side of his mouth. This outfit became his ""Nostalgia"" costume in ''Street Fighter V''.

In ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'' he is seen with no boxing gloves.&lt;ref&gt;http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Balrog_animated_movie.png&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', Balrog wears a blue openly hooded robe with yellow outlines and ripped sleeves; on the back it has the design of ""Crazy Buffalo"" in a black round sign, a large golden crown with clouds and several red stars, the outline on his boxing gloves are black with gold star designs, his boxer shorts are black and he wears matching boxing boots with white outlines. Likely in allusion to Mike Tyson's famous appearance in the Nintendo game ''Mike Tyson's Punch Out'', his black boxing shorts and boxing boots match those of Tyson in his appearance as the final boss of ''Punch Out's'' World Circuit.

His first alternate costume is business attire similar in design to the one he wore in ''[[Street Fighter II V]];'' the sleeves are rolled up into cuffs, his boxing gloves are gold and he wears sunglasses.

His second costume is somewhat similar to his primary outfit but with a United States flag motif. He wears a white and red striped long sleeve hoodie, blue trousers with white star designs, white sneakers and fingerless gloves.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Cammy,"
Cammy has light-blue eyes and long blonde hair that she styles into two braided pigtails, a large forelock, and a scar on her left cheek. She has a muscular body with a very fit physique and is of slightly below average height; Cammy's choice of clothing attire is a leotard as it gives her higher speed, mobility, and flexibility. 

In ''Super Street Fighter II'' and ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'', Cammy wears her signature outfit: a turtleneck, sleeveless, green thong leotard that consists of a Delta Red triangle insignia on either the right or left breast (some promo art has it on the right while other instances, including her endings in ''SSFII'', have it on the left), a red beret, red socks and black calf-high combat boots, and red gauntlets. Her legs were decorated with marks of green camouflage paint. This classic incarnation is known as ""Delta Red Cammy."" One of the earlier drafts of Cammy's character design has her wearing harnesses and a gun holster, details which were eventually incorporated into her ''Street Fighter V'' default design. 

In ''Cannon Spike'', Cammy wears an outfit similar to her ''SSFII'' incarnation, except she has knee pads and inline skates, as well as two sub-machine guns. In her right hand, she holds a standard Uzi sub-machine gun, and in her left, a Skorpion vz. 61. Both guns are depicted as comically larger in size compared to their real counterparts.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Alex,"
Alex is a very tall individual with a heavily built upper body and broad shoulders, but a comparatively slim waist and lower body that reflects his higher agility compared to other grapplers. In terms of facial features, he is often depicted having a tall face and strong nose. He has long blond hair that he keeps in a ponytail near the back, with long bangs in front that are kept out of his eyes by a red bandanna, one that is wide and short as opposed to being thin and long like Ryu's. His other attire consists of light green overalls with the straps hanging down, open-fingered gloves of the same color and brown lace-up combat boots. He also wears red body paint forming streaks that go down both of his shoulders, along with jagged streaks under his eyes. Some official artwork also depicts him wearing his default attire along with a [[wikipedia:Bomber jacket|bomber jacket]] (sometimes with a white button-up beneath it) or a sleeveless black t-shirt. His classic appearance is recreated with his ""Nostalgia"" costume in ''[[Street Fighter V]]''.

In his ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'' ending, Alex wears camo green MMA shorts, along with what appears to be slate-colored open-fingered gloves. In a piece of art depicting Alex's victory over [[Balrog]] in the [[Vale Tudo Eternal Fighting]] tournament, shown in an arcade flier for ''SFIII New Generation,'' he wears the same attire later used in his ''CFE'' ending, except his trunks have a red stripe along each side.

In ''Street Fighter V'', he wears red suspenders with black lining, a red and white plaid flannel shirt tied on his waist, tattered green jeans and black combat boots. His hair is cut short and slicked back with short fringes on each side which are hanging loose under his bandanna. His fingerless gloves are blue and black. In his ""City of Chaos"" stage background cameo, he is wearing his flannel, but with the sleeves rolled up.

In his character story, he gains a scar on his cheek during his fight with a reimagined Ryu, implying that he put the red marks on his eyes to match the scar.

He has several alternate costumes in the game, his first outfit is a white short sleeve v-neck shirt with a golden anvil emblazoned at the center that reaches his lower abs, green trousers with white linings in each sides, a matching green tie in the center and black boxers underneath. He is barehanded, walks barefoot and his hair is messy. Another is a white sleeveless shirt with a red X sign of ""Extraordinary"", green MMA shorts with his name imprinted on the buckle and a black thigh support within his shorts. His hair is longer and he wears a red cap and matching green MMA gloves with his imprinted name.

His premium work costume, which is that of a firefighter, consists of a pair of orange trousers with yellow outlines and designs and black short boots.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Charlie Nash,"
Due to Charlie's integral role as a character in Guile's backstory, many ''[[Street Fighter series|Street Fighter]]'' adaptations produced prior to the release of ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' featured various depictions of Charlie.

Charlie wears green cargo pants with boots of the same color and an orange flak vest. He has glasses, which he takes off before a fight, and an exaggerated hairstyle consisting of a large forelock of blond hair. The glasses are not necessary for him to see, and appear to be purely cosmetic. He has his classic outfit as an alternate costume in ''[[Street Fighter V]]''.

In ''[[Cannon Spike (video game)|Cannon Spike]]'', Charlie's flak vest is yellow, he has a black sleeveless undershirt within his jacket, his cargo pants are dark green and he wears a different shades of green combat boots.

Charlie retains a similar outfit for his return in ''Street Fighter V''; however, his body appears to have been patched back together, as it is covered in grotesque staples, and patches of his skin are discolored, implying he has had numerous skin grafts since his mission in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', or rather, since his death in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]''. His hair is now platinum blonde and his right forearm and hand, right shoulder, and the front-right portion of his skull including his eye, are crudely replaced and stapled up with transplanted dark-skinned body parts. These are implied to come from Eleven, one of the Illuminati's failed mimicry experiments. Another curious feature includes the green gem embedded in his forehead, which is similar to the ones implanted in [[Gill]]'s and [[Urien]]'s foreheads which it was casted upon by [[Kolin]] to keep himself alive. His flak vest and cargo pants are brown while his combat boots are light green. The upper outlines and the collar of his flak vest is golden yellow.

Charlie's premium outfit resembles his original concept art, which was referred to as ""assassin"".

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Cody,"
Before being arrested, Cody was clean-shaven, and his outfit consisted of blue jeans, white sneakers, a white t-shirt and blue bandages wrapped around his wrists as well as the lower half of his hands.

Cody's hair is dark blond in the [[Final Fight|original game]], [[Final Fight 2|its sequel]] and in ''[[Mighty Final Fight]]'', and light blond in all of his ''Street Fighter'' appearances, including the comics and the American television series. However, the official artwork for ''Final Fight'' suggests that Cody was always intended to be light blond. If that is the case, then his ''Final Fight'' sprites may have been subjected to a coloring error on the developers' part.

As a jailbird, he had facial stubble and handcuffs which were linked by a long chain. The hand bandages are white and cover the hands completely, leaving only the fingers exposed. The t-shirt and the jeans were replaced by an old-fashioned prison jumpsuit with white and blue stripes. He keep the white sneakers, though. Unlike most convicts, Cody does not mind being in his prison apparel but, as seen in his ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' taunt, he can easily remove the handcuffs. In ''Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition'', his jailbird outfit returns as his nostalgia costume, and his original outfit returns as his ""Final Fight"" costume.

In ''Final Fight: Streetwise'', he wears his original outfit with an orange prison shirt over the t-shirt. 

Some of the official artwork for ''Final Fight'' implied that Cody has always worn [[wikipedia:Adidas Superstar|Adidas Superstars]], but it was his ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' sprite that fully confirmed this idea. Guy wears Nikes, which may be a reference to the competition between the two sports brands in real life.

In his [[Shadaloo Combat Research Institute|Shadaloo C.R.I.]] profile artwork, Cody wears an orange prison outfit with the sleeves tied on his waist as well as a white tank top. He wears his white sneakers from his outfit in ''Final Fight''.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Cody, as a mayor, has a drastically altered appearance; his hair is now shorter and slicked back and he wears a business attire, including a purple formal vest with brown upper outlines, a light blue and white pinstriped long sleeve button-up shirt with the sleeves folded into cuffs and a red neck tie with brown and white linings on the collar, as well as black formal pinstripe pants with a gray belt around his waist which he had holstered his combat knife and black shoes. He notably no longer wears handcuffs or his iconic adidas shelltop sneakers that were part of outfit in ''Final Fight, Final Fight: Streetwise, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Super Street Fighter IV'' .

He has white suspenders beneath the jacket. His pants are white, his shoes are brown and his fedora hat is pink with black linings. He doesn't wear a tie but wears a silver watch on his left wrist and a single brown fingerless glove on his right hand.

Dan has a similar outfit to [[Ryu]] and [[Ken Masters|Ken]], wearing a traditional karate gi with a black undershirt much like [[w:c:snk:SNK|SNK]] fighter [[w:c:snk:Ryo Sakazaki|Ryo Sakazaki]]'s. He has brown eyes and brown hair in a ponytail, making his head and face closely resemble [[w:c:snk:Robert Garcia|Robert Garcia]] from SNK's ''[[w:c:snk:Art of Fighting (series)|Art of Fighting]]'', while his outfit is bright pink as a parallel to Ryo's usual orange. Supplementary materials claim that his gi was turned pink when unintentionally mixed color red whilst doing laundry. His gi is now his nostalgia outfit in ''Street Fighter V''.

His fighting stance is similar to Ken and Ryu's, due to originating as a palette-swap of those two; in later games, it is more ""loose"" and animated. As seen below, his appearance in ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001]]'' is more distinct in that he's lighter on his feet and his arms are positioned differently. In the ''[[Street Fighter IV (series)|Street Fighter IV]]'' series he abandons the traditional shoto stance entirely, instead slowly performing exaggerated ''mawashi-uke'' motions before transitioning to a parody of the stance used by Ryo Sakazaki in ''[[w:c:snk:The King of Fighters '97|The King of Fighters '97]]'' onward (a low ''shiko-dachi'' with outstretched arms). Many of his mannerisms directly mirror those of [[w:c:snk:Yuri Sakazaki|Yuri Sakazaki]]. His ''Street Fighter V'' stance is more rigid and compact, matching Ryo's stance in both the original ''Art of Fighting'' series and current ''The King of Fighters'' titles, while reverting to the ''shiko-dachi'' if left idle for enough time.

In his [[Shadaloo Combat Research Institute|Shadaloo C.R.I.]] profile art, Dan has his gi worn loose, he wears a black short sleeve shirt with a white kanji at the left; his gi pants have a single tear on the left leg. He also has started to grow some facial hair on his face. 

In both ''Street Fighter IV'' series through ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', he has the kanji 弾 (pronounced as Dan) in white on his back. His undershirt has a white kanji designs in the edge of his short sleeves, and his belt is notably shorter. His gloves are now purple instead of brown. In the anime cutscenes in ''Street Fighter IV'' through ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'' his undershirt is dark blue, and in ''Street Fighter V'', it is indigo. On his character story, he was wearing brown geta shoes when he went to Plaza Capcom.

His battle costume is a torn orange gi and undershirt similar to his father's. Dan wears a red tengu mask with a mustache and wears gray fingerless gloves.

Dee Jay is also seen in the [[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie|anime movie]] and some artwork with a Caribbean chain necklace.

Dee Jay's pants originally said ""MANTIS"" but since his right sprite is a mirror image of his left, the ""N"" and ""S"" would be reversed, so it was changed to ""MAXIMUM"", which is composed of symmetrical letters so that it is the same even when flipped horizontally so that his sprite would be the same regardless of facing.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Dhalsim,"
Dhalsim is often depicted with pupil-less white eyes. His build is that of a normal man who exercises and weight trains regularly, except for his abdomen and waist, which appear out of proportion and emaciated. His arms are also quite extraordinary in length, and he uses this to create an advantage over his opponents during fights, usually opting to wear them down from a distance. He wears torn yellow saffron shorts, held tied around his waist by a piece of rope, as his only clothing, as well as yellow saffron wristbands and anklebands. He has three red stripes adorning his head, hoop earrings, and metallic bracelets, and sometimes also anklets. In the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series, he wears a turban that he removes before battle, while in the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom series|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series he removes what appears to be a one-shoulder shirt. The skulls he wears around his neck are those of village children that died during a plague.

Dhalsim's minimal clothing and necklace of skulls are reminiscent of the Hindu ascetics known as Kapalikas (""skull-bearers""). Like [[Blanka]] and [[Urien]], Dhalsim's alternate costumes change his skin color, usually to a shade of grey or yellow reminiscent of the ash that Hindu holymen cover their bodies in.

In ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', he has gained a long white beard as a result from aging, and wears his turban rather than removing it.

Edmond Honda is a very heavy yet very muscular Japanese man, seemingly in his late 30s to early 40s. While not having the same height as [[T. Hawk]], [[Sagat]] or [[Zangief]], Honda is quite tall, though he does not appear to be due to his hunched-over fighting stance. He has black hair in a ''chonmage'' hairstyle and wears only a white and light blue ''mawashi'' with a striking red ''fundoshi'' underneath (the later is rarely seen). His face is painted in the ''kumadori'' style of red makeup used in kabuki. As a sumo wrestler, he always fights barefoot, though some artwork depicts him wearing a pair of ''geta'' (traditional Japanese wooden sandals with two ""elevated"" clogs). His classic appearance is his ""Nostalgia"" costume in ''Street Fighter V''.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Edmond wears a traditional mawashi worn by sumos in sumo wrestling; the color of his mawashi is sky blue. It's loincloth has a white mountain design along with white clouds at the center with a gold trim at the edge, and he wears single footwraps on his right feet and armwraps on his left arm.

His story costume is semi-casual attire; a white formal suit jacket with a purple and gold designed button-up shirt underneath, white formal pants and black dress shoes. 

His battle costume is a traditional outfit worn by ronin; a light blue traditional vest with designs and a dark blue traditional kimono shirt underneath, blue traditional pants and a geta sandals. He also has a katana strapped to his left side.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Elena,"
Elena is uncommonly tall for a female; being 6' (183cm) tall, she is currently the tallest female in the ''Street Fighter'' series. She has dark skin, short silvery-white hair and blue eyes. She is barefoot while fighting and has long, powerful legs. Many official artworks, mainly the ''SFIII'' ones, depict her finger and toenails painted sky-blue. Her attire consists of a white two-piece bikini-like outfit with pale red, sky-blue, gold and purple bands on her neck, arms, wrists, shins, and ankles. This makes her attire the most revealing for a playable female in the ''Street Fighter'' series' history.

In her [[Shadaloo Combat Research Institute|Shadaloo C.R.I.]] profile artwork, Elena's hair has slightly grown and is styled into a shoulder length bob. Her primary outfit remains largely the same. Her bands on her arm, leg, shin and ankles have two small bows hanging loose. She also has a gold bracelet in each sides of her wrists and ankles.

Much like [[Gill]] and his asymmetrical body, her revealing attire and the numerous colorful bands that adorn her body were likely designed by Capcom to display the graphical power of the CPS-3 board.

In her ''2nd Impact'' ending, she was wearing a Japanese school uniform similar to Sakura's, she has this outfit as her alternate costume in ''Street Fighter X Tekken''. In her ''3rd Strike'' ending, she was wearing a white high-neck sleeveless shirt, red pants and black shoes. She also carries a small black bag.

In a photo of Narumi and herself during the festivities in Japan, she was seen wearing a blue traditional style kimono dress with white butterfly designs and a salmon pink obi tied on her waist, the skirt show her right leg.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Evil Ryu,"
Evil Ryu first appeared as a palette swap of Ryu wearing a black or dark purple gi; in his gaming debut, the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Alpha]]'' series also gives him a black headband. His skin and hair also featured a slightly dark shade. From the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom series|SNK vs. Capcom]]'' series onward, his eyes been depicted with red irises, although some games have his eyes glow entirely red.

Like [[Akuma]], Evil Ryu has a signature kanji that appears when he performs the [[Raging Demon]]; in ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' and ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001|Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', the kanji is {{nihongo|""destruction""|滅|metsu}}, though it only appears in his endings and [[Super Combo]] Finishes.

In ''Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition'', his design was given an update; he takes on a much more menacing and powerful appearance, with traits taken from Akuma. He now has fangs, his eyes glow, his gi, gloves, and headband are torn, and his hair is spiked upwards with a reddish tint. His voice is also more demonic sounding, and he also constantly emits a dark red aura during fights.

Most notable of all is a gaping hole burned into his chest, with a similar scar on his back that bears a glowing {{nihongo|""heaven""|天|ten}} kanji. The scar resembles the effects of being hit up close with [[Oni]]'s [[Meido Gohado]], and could also be a reference to a scene in the [[Street Fighter III: Ryu Final|''Ryu Final'' manga]], in which Akuma punches through Ryu’s chest in their final battle and almost defeats him. In Ryu's guest appearance in ''Asura's Wrath'', it is Asura who gives him the scar after launching him into the moon from Earth and attempting to impale him with his fist. The scar disappears after he returns to normal.

Garuda is adorned in reddish-orange rusted samurai armor, and wears a horned helmet with a demonic-looking skeletal mask. He has a wild mane of blond hair, and pauldrons on either side of the armor with designs resembling demon faces. Garuda's armor is adorned with a gold belt with two tassels attached, and he wears blue hakama pants along with red vambraces and greaves with open-toed sandals.

His appearance is said to change depending on who observes him, so it is unknown if this is his true form.

In his [[Shadaloo Combat Research Institute]] profile artwork, Garuda's hair is white, his armor is a red hue, and has blue laces woven throughout it. His belt is more pronounced, and his armor is decorated with golden ornaments in several places.

In ''Fighting EX Layer'', Garuda hair remains blond but glows orange in-game. His mouth glows in yellow. His kimono shirt is navy blue, his red genji greaves from his armor reaches to his knees and his red shoulder armor has a silver trim that glows in a gold hue. He also gains a steel-like tail ends in each sides at the back of his shoulders. His navy blue hakama now have gold flame designs and wears a red genji boots are now demonic.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Gill,"
Gill's appearance is characterized by his half red and half blue muscular body and flowing blonde hair. He bears a distinct and intentional resemblance to a Greek God. In keeping with that theme, Gill fights completely unclothed except for a white thong around his hips.

Gill's asymmetrical color scheme was a device for [[Capcom]] to display the graphical power of the CPS-3 board. In previous 2D ''Street Fighter'' games, details such as [[Sagat]]'s eye-patch would switch sides depending on which way the character was facing. Originally, Gill was to be colored black and white, and utilize powers over light and darkness. It was later decided to color him red and blue, to better show off the game's graphical power. The black and white palette is used often as a secondary color. Additionally, Gill was designed wearing a loin cloth to show off as much of his red and blue hues as possible.

The sprite of Gill's secretary, [[Kolin]], has an intentionally asymmetrical haircut, so, like Gill, she appears graphically impressive when rotating from facing one direction to another, instead of being a mirrored sprite. In ''3rd Strike'', a special glow has been programmed to constantly render his sprite in both positive and negative coloration, further showing off the CPS-3 board's impressive graphical power. He is then known as ""Omega Gill"".

In the UDON comics, before he changed into his signature skin and eye colors, Gill's skin was tan and he had dark gray eyes. 

In his pre-fight intro in ''New Generation'' and ''2nd Impact'', Gill wears a long gray robe. In ''3rd Strike'', he wears a light brown and red hooded long cloak with a long blue green robe and matching brown sandals.

In ''Street Fighter V'', during Kolin's character story, Gill wears only a white robe-like cloak with the left side being sleeveless. This outfit later became his first alternate costume. Gill is also seen wearing a white robe in his own character story.

His battle costume resembles the outfit worn by the Roman Empire; a gold sleeveless armor with a matching helmet, gauntlets and leg guards, a brown Roman skirt that reaches below the knee and a long red cape. His flowing long blond hair is tied in a very low ponytail adorned with a white clip.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Guile,"
Early ''Street Fighter II'' sketches and notes suggest that Guile was developed specifically to appeal to American fans. His physical appearance is strikingly different from the many Asian characters in the ''Street Fighter'' series, with light blue eyes (green in ''Street Fighter V'') without eyebrows, a chiseled jaw, a permanently displeased expression, and his most recognizable feature: a particularly tall flattop haircut. The length of Guile's hair varies greatly from appearance to appearance; it is relatively realistic in ''Street Fighter II'', and impossibly tall in ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos]]''. Capcom source books suggest that Guile's famous hairdo is styled with a special-order army hair spray to keep it up, though he usually fixes it quickly after a match.

Guile's all-American image includes military fatigues and United States flag tattoos on each shoulder; following standard United States military protocol, the stars are on the left hand side to give the illusion that the flag is flying 'towards' battle. The image of the uniformed American Airman is well known in Japan due to the number of United States Armed Forces bases present in that country.

Guile wears [[Charlie]]'s dog tag alongside his own; in ''Street Fighter IV'', one of Guile's alternate costumes resembles Charlie's costume.

In ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', Guile wears a white military button shirt with dark blue emblems in each sides, a matching dark blue tie on the collar with 'US' emblems in each sides, dark blue military pants with a black belt on his waist and black combat shoes. He wears his signature sports sunglasses as part of his default costume and wears a blue ID with his imprinted full name on the right side and a gold eagle badge on the left. His first alternate costume is his classic attire from ''Street Fighter II'' and his second costume has him wearing a brown flak vest with a blue gray army jumpsuit with the sleeves are rolled up into cuffs and a white undershirt. He retains his sports sunglasses, black combat shoes, black watch, and Charlie's dogtag from his primary outfit.

His build is rather slim compared to many of the other characters. 

Guy wears a red or orange sleeveless ninja gi with a wire mesh shirt underneath for defense. In the ''Final Fight'' series, it resembled a karate gi with a thin, dark belt, but in the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series and beyond, it has a white outline around the arm holes and golden yellow bands around his waist and ankles. The kanji (武神, ''Bushin'') written on Guy's gi literally translates to ""god of military arts."" His footwear was originally a set of ninja boots in the first ''Final Fight'' game. In ''Final Fight 3'' and the ''Alpha'' series, Guy's footwear is changed to a pair of High-Top [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc. Nike] Dunks, an intentional contrast to the rest of his traditional outfit and a trademark of his often referenced by other characters and Guy himself in win quotes. In ''Super Street Fighter IV'', the [[wikipedia:Swoosh|Swoosh]] symbol was modified to look like a generic lighting bolt, possibly due to the fear of legal actions from Nike. Since ''Final Fight 3'', he also wears fingerless gloves.

His look in ''Final Fight: Streetwise'' is similar to his ''Final Fight 3'' appearance, except that he wears white and red sweatpants, a different pair of sneakers, and black fingerless gloves. He also has tattooed his left arm.

In the ''Street Fighter IV'' series, his first [[Alternate Costume|alternate costume]] is based on his original ''Final Fight'' outfit, with the main differences being an added sword and a white headband.

Hugo is a muscular hulk that stands at just under 8 feet.

Hugo usually wears a pink leopard skin tank-top with darker pink jeans, brown boots, and black studded wristbands. He wears a thick chain from the back of his waist, to 3/4 of the way around his waist, ending at his hip. He has long, messy black hair, that bounces and moves around as he moves and attacks.

In the ''[[Street Fighter III series|Street Fighter III]]'' series, his eyes are normally obscured by shadow during battle, giving him more of a sad look. During certain animations, they become visible, revealing that he has no pupils; later portrayals would make his pupils more visible.  Also during certain animations as he stands still or crouches, he does a very visible twitch/spasm.  The cause is unknown.

In ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'', Kairi appeared as a tall and muscular young man, with long black hair tied in a ponytail. His eyes are black with his left eye being scarred, possibly a relic of his duel to the death against his father. He wore a form fitting, sleeveless blue shirt, dark blue karate pants held by a black obi and wore blue handwraps and blue ankle wraps.

In ''[[Street Fighter EX2]]'' and onward, his appearance dramatically changed. His hair is no longer black but has become silvery-white, his eyes went from black to red and they seem to glow during certain special attacks or during some of his win poses. His body became covered in scars as a result of both him succumbing to his demonic powers and his endless string of battles. He wears white karate pants which are red near the top as well as a black belt. He no longer wears his shirt nor his leg warmers, his arms are covered in bandages and they are covered in blue flames whenever his power is at its highest point (gameplay-wise, when he has a full Super bar).

The ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' website has two different profiles for Kairi, based on his appearances in the first and second games. In his first profile, Kairi's karate pants are dark purple, he wears blue handwraps on both of his hands and his hair is black. In the second profile, he retains the same look he had in later games.

Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages that are wrapped around her shins, ankles, and instep, somewhat realistically protecting her from foot related injuries. Her garments are more revealing than normal ninja ones, however.

As seen in one of her win animations in ''Street Fighter III'', Ibuki's normal clothes consist of a white sleeveless loose shirt, blue denim pants, and gray and black sneakers. She also carries a yellow backpack. Her school uniform consist of a light blue sleeveless shirt under a white short sleeve button shirt with a red laced ribbon at the center of her collar, light blue skirt, black panties underneath, white socks, and blue and white sneakers.

Ibuki tends to have ninja themed accessories in some of her casual outfits.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Maki,"
Maki's hair is dyed blonde. Although younger than Rena, Maki is taller than her. Her hair tends to be long and held back in a ponytail, her bangs a lighter color than the rest. She wears a red female ninja garb. The top part of her outfit appears to have a halter neckline, with a wire mesh shirt and showing much of her back. Underneath the skirt of her outfit, Maki appears to be wearing matching panties. She wears arm and leg guards with boots. Her alternate palette in ''[[Final Fight 2]]'' changes her outfit color from red to blue.

Since ''[[Capcom vs SNK 2]]'', Maki was significantly revamped in terms of outfit and weaponry: she now wears red tennis shoes like the ones worn by Guy in the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series and wields a tonfa, which was originally a pick-up weapon in ''Final Fight 2''. Her hair is shown to be one complete color now, the leg guards are removed, and the shirt part of her attire is now closed, covering her back and more of her shoulders.

An image of Maki (along with her sister and Guy) in more casual attire exists from [[Capcom]], they all stand in front of Maki's motorcycle. Here, Maki wears a black leather halter top that buttons up near her neck and presumably her waist, black biker-style gloves, yellow baggy pants fastened by a black rope, and a long pink bandanna. Her hair isn't tied back in this design and is more of an auburn color retaining the brighter highlights for her bangs, and appears to be crimped.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,M. Bison,"
His general attire consists of a red military uniform with large silver shoulder plates, wrist bands, and shin guards; on his peaked/service cap is the skull insignia of his crime syndicate known as [[Shadaloo]]. His clothing highly resembles the Japanese and Chinese Imperial uniforms in red, as per his inspirational sources, with some possible influences from the uniforms worn by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel SS] officers of Nazi Germany; the winged skull on his visor cap and the first letter of Shadaloo on his belt is shaped as a single [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_insignia_of_the_Schutzstaffel#Runes_used_by_the_SS Sig rune]. He sports a dark-colored cape in the ''Alpha'' series, in which he appears with his original body. From ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' on (and in the ''Capcom vs SNK'' series), he appears with a much slimmer body, and removes his cape before battle.

M. Bison has neatly cut black hair under his peaked cap, which he is almost never seen without (save for two of his alternate costumes); in the Brazilian ''Street Fighter'' comics (Editora Escala), he was instead bald. His eyes were originally red both within and outside the irises (though the irises were still visible); after ''[[Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting]]'', they were changed to a complete ghastly white, a trait shared by other characters such as [[Sagat]] and [[Dhalsim]]. His eyes will glow pink when his Psycho Power is glowing.

As of ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', Bison's look has changed slightly, now wearing a trenchcoat over his outfit without the cape. His hair has also turned white due to the effects of Psycho Power.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Nanase,"
Nanase appears as a brown-haired teenage girl of average height, with her hair tied back in a ponytail. The top half of her outfit resembles a sleeveless floral-print yukata, with a purple shirt worn underneath it, as well as a breastplate on top and was tucked into a large orange belt with a yellow trim. The bottom half of her outfit is a blue skirt resembling that of a traditional Japanese schoolgirl's uniform, along with matching colored socks and green sneakers. She wears greenish-blue gloves, matching her breastplate in color. Underneath her skirt, she wore bloomers similar to Sakura's but the color is light purple.

In ''Street Fighter EX2'', Nanase's primary outfit has a minor color change in-game; her shirt is pale purple, the half of her sleeveless floral-print yukata is capri blue, her belt is red with an orange trim and both her gloves, socks and sneakers are dark blue.

In ''Street Fighter EX3'' her gloves are blue to match her floral-print yukata and her sneakers appear as indigo. Her skirt is also extended below her knee.

Her outfit remains mostly the same in her Shadaloo C.R.I. profile art, save for her gloves and breastplate being brighter in coloration, and her sneakers being colored white.

In ''[[Fighting EX Layer]]'', Nanase's hair is longer and its color is black (brown in her portrait). While assuming her name as Sanane, Nanase now wears a casual outfit; a pink and white high-neck dress with frills at the edge, a dark blue undershirt with an extended collar, and black stockings with gray cross strap designs. Both her sneakers and her gloves from her original outfit are now turquoise. She also wears a large lime green scarf on her neck with a rabbit pin at the left side. She also has a cross hairclip at the left side of her hair and black, gray and dark green headphone on her neck. During her win pose, Nanase carries a wooden bo staff instead of the red and black naginata she previously wielded.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Necro,"
Necro is a tall, lean individual who is completely bald and ghastly white, with orange-red markings on his face and shoulders. The loss of color in his skin can be attributed to his mutation; his stage in ''New Generation'' and ''2nd Impact'' hints in the background that various animals and even materials, from octopuses to rubber, had their properties infused genetically into his being. In comparison, [[Twelve]] is a product of similar experiments. The markings could possibly be a result of the mutation as well. Necro's eyes are a light yellow and lack both pupils and irises.

Wrapped around the base of his neck is a metallic collar, with a bolt on the front and two on the back. The only clothes Necro seems to wear are a pair of overalls with several straps around the chest, cuffs around his wrist, and a pair of boots, all in the same vibrant violet color.  His suspenders appear to be attached to his collar in most artworks.  In some artworks, he also appears to be wearing small, gold earrings, and on-screen in the game, his fingernails appear to have red nail polish.

As revealed when electrocuted in a fight, Necro's arm and leg bones are segmented, presumably a result of the G-Project. This allows for his limbs to stretch to inhuman lengths, yet keep their shape when at ""normal"" lengths.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Oro,"
Oro is an ancient hermit who has thin black hair, golden skin, crimson eyes that glow light blue during battle and is barefoot. His only prominent article of clothing is a large single torn red tarp-like cloth, belted with a rope and appears to be like a kesaya or chiton like robe draped over his left shoulder and tied at a knot. A magic spell binds one of his arms and he normally fights one-handed, but he can dispel its effects and pull out the other arm at any time. Standing at 5'3"" (161 cm), Oro is the shortest playable male character in the ''Street Fighter'' series. 

In ''Street Fighter V'', Oro's outfit is purple and the robe has a single long sleeve to show his right hand.

His first alternate costume in ''Street Fighter V'' has him wearing a modern outfit consisting of a sky blue cloud printed-theme short-sleeved button shirt with white crane designs, white shorts and white sandals with brown straps. He also has sunglasses with a red trim that sticks out the collar of his shirt. The outfit is reminiscent of Dragon Ball's [https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Roshi Master Roshi], an eccentric elderly hermit with a weakness for young women associated with turtles, similar to Oro. This button shirt was given to him by [[Rose]] as a little souvenir following their sparring match.

His second alternate costume is that of a Japanese warlock consist of gray furred Japanese vest being tied in a yellow belt sash, with a blue gray short sleeved kimono shirt that reaches below the knee, he also wore both handwraps and footwraps and a geta with open straps. 

Oro is revealed to have a white fundoshi beneath his outfits whenever he stands up and ready to fight.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,R. Mika,"
Mika has long, blonde hair with bangs that are tied in two geometrical pigtails and blue eyes. Her attire is a blue and white lingerié-like leotard with ruffles around areas such as the collar, the sleeves, and the leg-holes, wrestling boots with white stockings and a white bustier with blue hearts on both bosoms. This is stark contrast to many of the Japanese characters of ''Street Fighter'' who often tend to have black and/brown hair and eyes respectively (with the exception of [[Karin|Karin Kanzuki]]).

Her attire is meant to be flamboyant, so she can stand out from the more experienced wrestling pools and circles. She possibly aims for making her arm joints less constricted due to the exposed portions of her uniform around her elbows, shoulders, breasts and buttocks. Her outfit is considered to be one of the most revealing designs of all the series' playable female characters.

In ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', her appearance remains largely the same, with minor modifications to her outfit. She has notably matured, having a bigger bust and bulking up in muscle considerably, She retains the same colors except the blue hearts on her chest were removed with a new white, heart-shaped bustier. Because of the shift from sprites to 3D models, her pigtails are animated more realistically. 

She has two [[alternate costumes]] in the game; the first is a blue wrestling suit with a single long sleeve identical to Zangief's first alternate costume, and the other is her primary outfit modified in a phoenix motif with different shades of red and phoenix feathered design on her wrestling mask.

Her premium swimsuit costume is a one piece covered by a hoodie. The one piece swimsuit has a white heart design on the chest and white stripes on the sides. Mika also wears blue ""MIKA"" named bracelets on both arms. She also wears blue open toed flip-flop sandals. The hidden variation of her swimsuit removes her hoodie, just leaving the one piece.

Sakura typically fights in her school's uniform - a short-skirted sailor uniform ([[wikipedia:Japanese school uniform|seifuku]]) with the collar popped and red bloomers (short shorts) underneath. She also wears red Converse-esque shoes, a midriff-baring red top under her uniform, red sparring gloves, a yellow neckerchief, and a white headband that was given to her by [[Ryu]] before the events of ''Street Fighter Alpha 2''. She has short brown hair and brown eyes. Her fuku is blue with single white linings in each sides and white socks. In ''Street Fighter IV'' and ''Street Fighter X Tekken'', her socks are shorter and the color is navy blue. Her school uniform becomes her ""Nostalgia"" costume in ''Street Fighter V''. 

In her ending in ''Super Street Fighter IV'', her hair is slightly longer, she wears a red high-neck sporty jacket with a single line at the center, a white short sleeved undershirt, black shorts, white socks and white sneakers with matching designs. She also maintains her white headband.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Sakura wears a different outfit (her college uniform) that consists of a navy blue vest with a pink trim, a white long sleeve button shirt underneath, a pleated skirt with frills at the edge, black mid-length socks and black short (possibly Docs) boots. Her bolero tie is long and the color are pink and white and is tied at her midriff baring top. Like Ryu's, her headband is red along with matching gloves with a stylized written on the white lines. She also has a head microphone at her left ear.

In combat, Sodom wears tabi and zori, samurai gauntlets, blue jeans, body armor, and a samurai kabuto with a mask, which obscures his facial features entirely; however, it is known that he has blue eyes.

On the front of his outfit, Sodom has attempted to scrawl the Japanese kanji ''shi'' (死), meaning ""death"". However, he has not written the kanji properly, and thus its meaning is lost.

He is never seen fighting without a pair of jitte or katana blades, making him one of the few characters to appear in the ''Street Fighter'' series to use weaponry. In the Japanese version of ''Final Fight'', the katana are named Masamune and Muramasa.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Sodom's body armor has long sleeves, he wears a black traditional mask with very long white shaggy hair in a similar look to [[Garuda]]'s helmet and mask. He uses a pair of large sai instead of the jitte, and his samurai gauntlets are black. He wears traditional aqua blue pants with linings and his zori has curly designs in each sides. Notably, he finally writes ''shi'' properly on his chest.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Urien,"
Urien has a similar appearance to [[Gill]], having exactly the same physical build (i.e. that of a Greek Olympic athlete) with dark bronze skin tones and short, metallic white hair. On his forehead, he has a small jewel crowning it (similar to a Bindi), and his shocking animation reveals it to be embedded directly into his skull. He also wears a simple loincloth.

In his pre-match introduction in the ''[[Street Fighter III series|Street Fighter III]]'' series, he appears as a pale-skinned man with short blonde hair and wears a light brown (white in his ''3rd Strike'' ending) business attire; he then sheds the suit, his skin darkens to a bronze complexion, and his hair turns from blonde to metallic white.

Many of his alternate colors are similar to those of [[Dhalsim]], in that they change his skin color as opposed to his costume's color. This ability to change skin and hair color could be the result of his control over metal. In his time over sprite, he reverts back to his normal state and his skin becomes pale.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Urien wears his business attire as his primary outfit with minor changes; the suit is gray with white pinstriped designs, he wears a partially unbuttoned purple button shirt and no tie. His skin, hair and the blue gem on his forehead still remains in his transformed state. If the player holds specific buttons as a match is about to begin, Urien will incinerate his clothes and fight in his loincloth as in ''Street Fighter III''. When this is done, any alternate costume additions to his head or face such as longer hair or sunglasses will be retained. In Gill's character story, the color of the business attire is white and dark pink.

His first alternate costume has him wearing sunglasses and his business attire, but it is purple, without the button shirt, white shoes, and a long white scarf draped over his neck. His second alternate costume is his classic attire in ''Street Fighter III''.

His crossover costume in ''Street Fighter V'' closely resembles Capcom character [[w:c:residentevil:Albert Wesker|Albert Wesker]] from ''[[w:c:residentevil:Resident Evil 5|Resident Evil 5]]'', his leather trenchcoat is shown to be jet black, and his zippered turtleneck, pants and boots are charcoal gray.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Vega,"
Vega is a tall, strikingly handsome young man with long hair that is braided into a ponytail. His hair has switched between brown, black, and blond through various ''[[Street Fighter series|Street Fighter]]'' media. In the ''[[Street Fighter II (series)|Street Fighter II]]'' series, Vega's hair is colored brown in the sprites, but colored blond in the endings that feature him. The comics give him blond hair, as do ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter V]]''. In ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', Vega has brown hair in both the cutscenes and the gameplay. He wears murrey and yellow ceremonial trousers, a red sash, loafers, and white leggings of a matador, suggesting his involvement with bullfighting. This decorative garb offers matadors ease of movement, and is therefore ideal for Vega's acrobatic maneuvers. Vega also has a purple snake tattoo on his chest which circles his left arm, and on his right arm and both his wrists he wears gold-colored armlets. The tattoo shows him to be a villain to a Japanese audience, where body tattoos are usually worn by [[wikipedia:Yakuza|Yakuza]] members. In ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001|Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', as a win pose, Vega will hold his arm out, with the tattoo coming to life and hissing at the opponent. In most ''Street Fighter'' media, he also maintains long and sharp nails on his hands.

Early sketches suggest that Vega was going to resemble a medieval knight wearing a full suit of armor. This idea was scrapped, as ''Street Fighter'' was about fighters from all over the world, not from different time periods. There are a few remnants of this concept in Vega's final design, specifically a mask and a sharp metal claw. A similar type of weapon was used by [[Geki]] in the original ''[[Street Fighter]]'', which has led to speculation that Vega received some training from Geki.{{Fact}}

Vega's concept of being a Spanish ninja was not originally in the planning. In the later phases of development, a handful of concepts such as a ninja character, a Thai character and a Spanish character were left incomplete, to which artist Mizuho ""Katuragi"" Kageyama was assigned to create. Initially, Vega was meant to be a Thai ninja, but was suddenly told to make a Spanish ninja in a similar style to the [[w:c:hokuto:Nameless_Asura|Nameless Asura]], an antagonist in the [[community:c:hokuto:Fist_of_the_North_Star|Fist of the North Star series]] known for his immense agility, distinct mask, bladed weapons and braided ponytail.

Vega has a white mask that is lacking in facial features or expressions. There is a purple symbol on his mask, the same color as his tattoos. It is difficult to tell how durable his mask is. On one hand, Vega is able to crush it to dust with one hand if he loses due to a time over in ''Street Fighter Alpha 3''. On the other hand, it takes several hits before the mask falls off and, even then, he can easily pick up and reapply the mask, with no apparent lasting damage.

Much like [[Sagat]]'s eyepatch in earlier games, Vega's claw will always appear on whatever arm matches the direction he is facing (if he is looking to left side of the screen, it will appear on his left arm, and if he's looking right, it will be on his right) due to sprite mirroring. In the ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'' series, it will always be on his right arm. In ''Street Fighter IV'', however, he changes his claw every time he switches sides, without mirroring; this can be seen in his tattoo, his accessories, and in the mark on his mask. Curiously enough, during the versus screen, his portrait won't be mirroring all the accessories either, with the unique exception of his claws.

In ''Street Fighter V'', Vega retains his claws and red waist sash but is now wearing a partially opened white shirt. His traditional matador pants are now a light blue denim. The purple snake tattoo that encircles his torso can still be partially seen. His alternate costume is an altered version of his outfit. The sleeves of his frill shirt are short and his signature mask is replaced with a golden opera mask.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Zangief,"
Zangief is a massive fighter, weighing 400 lbs and standing slightly over 7 feet tall, placing him as one of the tallest characters in the entire ''[[Street Fighter series|Street Fighter]]'' roster. Since his debut in ''Street Fighter II: The World Warrior'' in 1991, Zangief has been portrayed with a beard and a mohawk, along with a uniquely-shaped formation of chest hair on his torso and on his shins. His massive frame is almost entirely covered in scars from his bouts with brown bears in the barren and remote area of Siberia.

Zangief's wardrobe consists of simple red wrestling trunks with a gold belt, along with red and gold wristbands and his red wrestling boots with gold trim. In one of Zangief's concept artworks, he wore a tank top and had a sailor anchor tattoo on his left arm. He would retain the tank top in all his ''Street Fighter II'' portraits (except ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo#Game Boy Advance|Turbo Revival]]'' and ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix|HD Remix]]''), in order to indicate what color the player chose for him. 

Starting with ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'', Zangief was adorned with a red cloak that he would remove before starting his matches. The cloak became an accepted fixture of his image and he was shown with it in the 1994 ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie|Street Fighter II]]'' animated movie. Although modern 3D interpretations of Zangief have so far not shown him with his cloak, he is still depicted as wearing it before matches in his ending movie on ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''.

He has multiple alternate costumes in ''[[Street Fighter V]]''. The first one is a red wrestling suit with a single long sleeve; another is a red tank top with a golden lightning emblem at the center along with the sign of ""METAL"", yellow tights in a rainbow camouflage motif with black kneepads and yellow boots with a red lightning motif. He also wears black studded armbands and a yellow bandana on his head with a matching rainbow camouflage motif.

Abel is a very well built individual who bears a strong look-alike resemblance with [[Seth]]. This is due to the fact that the two were originally meant to be one of M. Bison's many spare bodies. What makes him different to Seth is that due to his success, Abel was either made to look human or because he was a ""mold"" for all male dolls, where as Seth has grey skin and black/glowing eyes.

He towers over many of the other characters, having similar bulk to [[Alex]]. He wears a blue kurtka (Sambo ""gi"") top with white spandex shorts, blue shin guards and thick gloves, alluding to his MMA appearance. He has blue eyes and sports a ""faux-hawk"", and is covered in scars from head to toe, most likely from being experimented on, or from being damaged in the wreckage he was found in.

In ''[[Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind]]'', Abel's kurtka is black instead of blue.

In ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', during [[Guile]]'s character story, Abel wore a blue Shadaloo uniform under disguise. After getting injured by [[F.A.N.G]], and the events of ''[[A Shadow Falls]]'', he wears a casual outfit; a blue short sleeved collared shirt, white trousers and blue slippers. He has bandages on his left arm, face, and forehead.

Rufus's basic appearance is that of a tall, morbidly obese man with blond hair in a braided ponytail and a mustache and beard. He wears yellow and black jumpsuit and black short-necked combat boots.

For ''Super Street Fighter IV'', a third outfit intended to resemble the Chinese Jiang Shi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending from the front of the hat and over his face.

The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.

In his Shadaloo C.R.I. profile art, the colours of his outfit are switched (black and yellow), he has orange goggles on his head and yellow gloves.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Go Hibiki,"
Go's appearance could have been inspired by an illustration showing [[Sagat]] holding a man similar to Dan by the head. The man also appears in one of Sagat's intro animations in the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series. The character in question has been speculated to be Go, but this has never been confirmed nor denied.

In ''[[Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix|Pocket Fighter]]'', Go remains somewhat similar in appearance to Dan, though he sports a green gi and a halo over his head. He also has more of a [[wikipedia:Tengu|tengu]]-like appearance, with red skin, a wide double chin and a long nose. Much like Dan, this design is a parody of [[w:c:snk:SNK|SNK]] character [[w:c:snk:Mr. Karate|Mr. Karate]] and his trademark ''tengu'' mask. Mr. Karate is the alter-ego of [[w:c:snk:Takuma Sakazaki|Takuma Sakazaki]], who is the father of [[w:c:snk:Ryo Sakazaki|Ryo Sakazaki]] (the character whom Dan is designed to be a parody of). Earlier works featured Go wearing a ''tengu'' mask, while later ones show that the long nose was indeed a feature of his face.

In the [[Street Fighter (UDON)|UDON comics]], his facial structure is slightly based on his ''Pocket Fighter'' appearance, with a wide cleft chin and a slightly longer nose. His hairstyle is slightly similar to Dan's, but short without a ponytail.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,C. Viper,"
C. Viper wears a specially designed Battle Suit for the tournament, developed and manufactured by [[S.I.N.]]. When inquired by an Executive as to the reason for her participation in the tournament, she states that she's the only test subject to fully utilize the suit's [[C. Viper#Fighting style|capabilities]] effectively, and thus is the prime candidate for the field test.

The suit is remarkable in the sense that it resembles an ordinary business suit, though two weapons lurk within the accompanying gloves and boots. The Battle Suit presumably does not protect the wearer from damage, as it was designed for stealth and ease of concealment.

One of her alternate costumes in the ''Street Fighter IV'' games is a white science coat, black dress with a revealing top and black high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v","the suit's The suit an ordinary business suit two weapons the accompanying gloves and boots her alternate costumes in the ''Street Fighter IV'' games a white science coat, black dress with a revealing top and black high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v"

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Oni,"
Oni appears as a far more muscular and noticeably larger version of Akuma. He has dark blue skin, glowing yellow-red eyes and glowing, spiky shoulder-length hair, fangs and short protrusions on his forehead, resembling growing horns. The top half of his gi has been blown off by the amount of dark ki he emanates, showing off his musculature; the prayer beads that were once around his neck now float about disconnected around his body. He also has claws on his fingers and toes, and no longer wears sandals; his voice also sounds much more demonic, akin to the demons of Asian myths. While Akuma had a blood red aura, Oni possesses a deep blue aura.

When using fierce attacks or powerful physical attacks of any kind, his arms and legs glow a superheated color. While it is difficult to spot, the kanji of {{Nihongo|""heaven""|天|ten}} also appears on his back during the same animations, seemingly having branded itself on his back. In his second [[alternate costume]], his skin shows cracks like old plaster, which progressively fall away as he is hit with [[Focus Attack]]s, showing pure, swirling dark energy underneath; he is the only character to possess such a costume.

Most characters do not recognize Oni as a form of Akuma, even Akuma himself (although Oni recognizes Akuma as his former self). In fact, [[Zangief]] is the only fighter to notice Oni's increased build mass; however, Zangief fails to notice any other changes (such as the blue skin, aura, etc.). The only character that recognizes Oni as a form of Akuma is Gouken due to his win quote against him in Street Fighter IV.

Ryu is portrayed as a Japanese man whose basic and most recognizable attire from the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' timeline consists of medium-length brown hair, brown eyes, a long, red headband, a white karate gi with the sleeves ripped off at the shoulders, completely bare feet, and a black martial arts belt. Ryu's first appearance in the original ''[[Street Fighter]]'' replaced the red headband with a white one and depicted him with bright red hair, gray eyes, and red slippers. In the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha series|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series, Ryu’s hair became a lighter shade of brown, and he retained the white headband which hearkens back to his appearance in the first ''Street Fighter''. Ryu would not canonically receive his red headband until after a sparring session with [[Ken Masters|Ken]] during this timeline. In ''[[Street Fighter III]]'', Ryu has black hair, and facial stubble to show his growth in age. Ryu's gi becomes increasingly tattered and aged throughout the game’s timeline, indicating its years of wear and tear. Ryu's most recent appearance in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' has him in his original ''Street Fighter II'' outfit.

In many of his appearances, Ryu carries around a large, white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets, passports, and local currency.

In some official ''Street Fighter II'' artwork, Ryu's belt has four kanji emblazoned upon it: ''kaze'' (風 wind), ''hayashi'' (林 woods), ''hi'' (火 fire) and ''yama'' (山 mountain); these four kanji make up the ''furinkazan''. The same four kanji can be seen on a sign on the left-hand side of Ryu's stage in ''Street Fighter II''. The four words are based on chapter seven of Sun Tzu's ''Art of War'', which dictates how one should conduct battle: ''""as fast as the wind, as quiet as the forest, as daring as fire, and immovable as the mountain.""'' These kanji are again visible on his belt in Street Fighter IV.

Under the waistcoat, a formal white shirt can be seen and a gold pocket-watch hangs from the left side of his waistcoat.

For unknown reasons, small areas of G's skin, most noticeably the area around his left eye and on his arms appear to be gold, presumably due to Geokinesis.

At 330 lbs, G is unusually heavy for his size, though it may have some relation to the golden markings on his skin.

G's first alternate costume, his story outfit, is a trench coat with a button-up shirt and tie, gloves, and a metal mask over the face, showing the sides and back of his head, bearing an uncanny resemblance to a [[Q|certain masked fighter]].

The suit is red and short sleeved and the dress shirt itself is short enough to expose her abdomen is clad in red and white (the suit is different in Cody's Arcade Ending in the ''Street Fighter V'' path, as the entire outfit is black and white, the jacket is long sleeved and it is long enough to cover her abdomen). Strangely, in all of her appearances thus far, the entirety of her face hasn't been shown at all; often showing her face covered in shadow with her glasses ""glowing"" or part of her face being ""off-screen"" or covered up by another character or object.

https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki,Kage,"
Kage's physical appearance is very similar to [[Ryu]]'s, both seeming to stand at the same height, although Kage appears to have a somewhat higher degree of musculature as well as a considerably darker skin-tone. In addition to this, Kage's irises are red and luminescent whilst his sclerae are jet black and the eyes are permanently encircled by a dark ring.

For clothing, Kage wears a dark blue gi with the top ripped off and left hanging around the legs, leaving his upper half completely bare aside from his red headband which now hangs loosely around his neck. Kage's hair retains the colour of Ryu's but is longer and spikier, and he has a pair of small horns that glow purple protruding from within (when struck by electric attacks, it is shown that the horns are part of the skull itself). Kage has a prominent under-bite and his lower canines are greatly elongated to form sharp tusks. Some parts of Kage's body bear open holes (similar to [[Oni]]'s second [[alternate costume]] when hit by [[Focus Attack]]s, only smaller) revealing purple Satsui no Hado energy within his body. He wears gloves identical to Ryu's though a darker shade of red.

An early concept art reveals Kage’s true form might or was supposed to be nothing but all covered in shadow, a shadow demon himself, with few essence from those of Ryu’s, such as his iconic red headband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/File:Kage-sfv-concept-artwork3.jpg Early concept art of Kage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patient on Floor 0000.jpeg|left|thumb|A patient travels to [[Floor 0000]]. ([[TV]]: ''[[World Enough and Time (TV story)|World Enough and Time]]'')]]
The patients were partially [[Cyber-conversion|cyber-converted]] [[Mondasian]]s, although their appearance drastically differed from more traditional [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]. As their name implied, the patients resembled [[hospital]] [[patient]]s, wearing white chest cloths with a slim [[chest unit]] ([[TV]]: ''[[World Enough and Time (TV story)|World Enough and Time]]'') featuring a [[computer]]ised display unit underneath, ([[PROSE]]: ''[[Alit in Underland (short story)|Alit in Underland]]'') connected by tubing. The patients also possessed caucasian [[glove]]s that closely resembled [[human]] [[hand]]s, and their [[head]]s were completely enveloped in [[plastic]] [[bag]]s that were tied in a large knot at the top of the head. Tubing also fed into the patients' [[nose]]s from behind their [[neck]]s, which also sported a plastic, [[silver]] [[band]]. 

The early patients lacked any sort of distinct facial features, but as they evolved further, the patients' faces and heads began to more closely resemble those of [[CyberMondan]]s; by the time [[Bill Potts]] left the [[Hospital (World Enough and Time)|hospital]] of [[Floor 1056]] for the first time, one patient possessed a [[mouth slit]]. ([[TV]]: ''[[World Enough and Time (TV story)|World Enough and Time]]'') Additionally, shortly before the people of Floor 1056 were mass-converted, ([[TV]]: ''[[The Doctor Falls (TV story)|The Doctor Falls]]'') at least two patients left in the hospital's [[Conversion Theatre]] possessed a face with completely [[black]] oval-shaped [[eye-pod]]s, and a black oval-shaped hole for a [[mouth]]. One of the patients who restrained Bill for her cyber-conversion was similar in design, but also possessed a grooved, silver helmet with a band around its edge, resembling part of a CyberMondan's [[Cyber-helmet]].
